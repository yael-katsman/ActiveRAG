It allowed hunger-striking prisoners, particularly suffragettes, to be released when their health was threatened and then re-arrested when they had recovered. The purpose of the act was to prevent suffragettes from becoming martyrs in prison and to provide for the release of those whose hunger strikes and forced feeding had brought them sickness, as well as their re-imprisonment once they had recovered.

The introduction of the Cat and Mouse Act was a response to the hunger strikes of suffragettes and the government's attempt to prevent them from gaining martyrdom. By understanding this historical context, the model can improve its ability to recognize and analyze causal relationships in similar historical or contemporary situations.
