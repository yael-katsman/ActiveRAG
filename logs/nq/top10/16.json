The toddler years are characterized by significant cognitive, emotional, and social development, including the transition from whole milk to low-fat or nonfat milk at around age 2. The developmental timeline of toddlers varies greatly from child to child, with some mastering skills like walking before others, and close siblings showing variation in achieving key milestones. Additionally, the passages mention the transition from a toddler bed to an ordinary bed, typically occurring between the ages of five and seven years.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge familiar to the model includes the general definition of a toddler as a child between 12 to 36 months old and the developmental milestones associated with this stage, such as walking, language development, and social skills. The advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the specific age-related transitions, such as the shift from whole milk to low-fat or nonfat milk at age 2, and the transition from a toddler bed to an ordinary bed between the ages of five and seven years. \n\nRole of Contents:\nBy familiarizing the model with the associateal knowledge and advanced information about toddler development, the model's understanding of the question about the age at which a child is no longer a toddler is deepened.

Understanding the variability in milestone achievement among toddlers and the transition to a regular bed at a certain age can help the model grasp the causal relationships between age, development, and physical capabilities. Additionally, recognizing that three-year-olds may still exhibit toddler-like behavior at times can enhance the model's logical inference abilities by acknowledging the nuances in children's behavior and development.
