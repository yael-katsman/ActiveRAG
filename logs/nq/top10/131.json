They inhabit the deserts of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America, living in arid lowland or mountainous shrubland with scattered brush. They are non-migratory and are found in states such as California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado, as well as in various Mexican states.\n\nThe roadrunner is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on insects, small reptiles, rodents, small birds, eggs, and fruits and seeds. It is known for preying upon rattlesnakes and being the only real predator of tarantula hawk wasps. The greater roadrunner can be found in arid and semiarid scrubland with scattered vegetation and may lower its body temperature slightly during the cold desert night to conserve energy.\n\nAdditionally, the passages mention the behavior of roadrunners, such as living alone or in pairs, being monogamous, and holding a territory all year. The reproductive season is in spring to mid-summer, and the male performs a courtship display for the female.\n\nThis information deepens the understanding of where roadrunners live in the desert, their diet, behavior, and habitat preferences.
