One contradictory piece of information is that prior to 1986, people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14, since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes, and those under that age seldom had substantial income. However, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction. This suggests that the model's existing knowledge about the age at which Social Security numbers were obtained may be inaccurate.\n\nAdditionally, the passage mentions that Social Security numbers were first issued by the Social Security Administration in November 1935 as part of the New Deal Social Security program. This historical information could update the model's knowledge and prevent factual errors related to the origin of Social Security numbers.\n\nBy incorporating this information into the model's knowledge base, it can prevent model illusions and ensure that the AI's outputs are based on accurate and reliable information.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
