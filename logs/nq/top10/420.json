Phytochemicals: These are chemicals produced by plants through primary or secondary metabolism and generally have biological activity in the plant host. They play a role in plant growth or defense against competitors, pathogens, or predators. The role of phytochemicals in plant growth and defense mechanisms could be unfamiliar to the model.\n\n2. Mycorrhizal networks and infochemicals: Mycorrhizal networks facilitate communication between plants of the same or different species, allowing for the transfer of signals and cues that influence the behavior of connected plants. The chemical substances acting as these signals and cues, referred to as infochemicals, can be allelochemicals, defensive chemicals, or nutrients. The concept of plant communication through mycorrhizal networks and the role of infochemicals in influencing plant behavior may be unfamiliar to the model.\n\n3. Plant hormones and growth regulators: Plant hormones are chemicals that promote and influence the growth, development, and differentiation of cells and tissues in plants. They are vital to plant growth, affecting processes from flowering to seed development, dormancy, and germination. The concept of plant hormones and their role as growth regulators may provide unfamiliar knowledge to the model.\n\n4. Physiological dormancy and abscisic acid: Physiological dormancy in plants is broken when inhibiting chemicals, such as abscisic acid, are broken down or no longer produced by the seed. The production of abscisic acid can be affected by light, and it plays a role in regulating seed dormancy. The concept of physiological dormancy and the role of abscisic acid in seed dormancy may be unfamiliar to the model.\n\n5. Plant physiology and hormone biosynthesis: Plant physiologists study the ways that plants control or regulate internal functions, including the biosynthesis of plant hormones within plant tissues. The diffuse nature of hormone biosynthesis within plant tissues and the lack of localized glands for hormone production in plants may be unfamiliar concepts to the model.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",

Some examples of plant hormones include auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid, and ethylene. Each of these hormones plays a unique role in regulating plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli.\n\n4. The production and distribution of plant hormones are tightly regulated processes, involving biosynthesis, transport, and signal transduction pathways within the plant.\n\n5.
