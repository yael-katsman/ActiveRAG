The NSAI \"pint\" mark, a circle featuring two wavy lines, between which \"PINT\" is written, with a year mark (last two digits), and a three digit batch code either side, is being phased out with a European standard \"PINT\"/CE logo stamp. This information provides background on the standard markings and inspections for pint glasses in Ireland, which may be unfamiliar to the model.\n\n2. The international glass code is based on U.S. military standard MIL-G-174, and is a six-digit number specifying the glass according to its refractive index \"n\" at the Fraunhofer d- (or D-) line, 589.3 nm, and its Abbe number \"V\" also taken at that line.
