        "logician_output": "Enhanced reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to enhance causal reasoning and logical inference abilities:\n\n1. The Irish Rebellion of 1798, also known as the United Irishmen Rebellion, marked a significant turning point in the Irish struggle for independence from England. The rebellion, led by Wolfe Tone and other Irish nationalists, sought to overthrow British rule in Ireland and establish an independent Irish republic.\n\n2. The Act of Union in 1800, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, further solidified British control over Ireland. This legislative union was met with resistance from Irish nationalists and fueled the desire for independence.\n\n3. The Anglo-Irish War, also known as the Irish War of Independence, erupted in 1919 as a result of increased tensions between Irish nationalists and British forces. The guerrilla warfare tactics employed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the political efforts of Sinn F\u00e9in, led by figures such as Michael Collins and \u00c9amon de Valera, played a crucial role in challenging British authority.\n\n4. The signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921 marked a pivotal moment in Ireland's quest for independence. The treaty, which established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth, was met with mixed reactions and ultimately led to a split within the Irish nationalist movement.\n\n5. The establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, with the partition of Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, represented a compromise in the pursuit of Irish independence. This compromise, while granting a degree of autonomy to the Irish Free State, also led to ongoing tensions and conflicts, particularly in relation to the status of Northern Ireland.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the enhanced reasoning process, Ireland gained its independence from England in 1922 with the establishment of the Irish Free State.",
