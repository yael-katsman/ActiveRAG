This provides background knowledge about the presence of diastema in different species and its role in their identification.\n\n2. \"The external naris (the nostril opening in the skull) is bordered only by the premaxillae bones. Each premaxilla has four teeth set into it. There is a gap called a diastema in the premaxillary tooth row, and a diastema in between the premaxillary and maxillary teeth.\" - This passage introduces the presence of diastema in the context of the skull anatomy of \"C. paulistanus\", providing specific details about the location and role of diastema in the dental arrangement of this species.\n\n3. \"The interdental gum lies between the teeth. They occupy the gingival embrasure, which is the interproximal space beneath the area of tooth contact.

It can be caused by an imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth, as well as by the presence of a large labial frenum from the upper lip extending near the teeth. Treatment for diastema may involve periodontal surgery, orthodontics, or dental restorations.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the presence of diastemata in various species of mammals as a normal feature, the specific anatomical characteristics of ornithosuchids and \"C. paulistanus\" related to diastemata, and the presence of interdental gum and interdental papilla between the teeth. Additionally, the term \"angularis nigra\" or \"black triangle\" refers to the space or gap seen at the cervical embrasure below the contact point of some teeth, and its potential treatments involve periodontal, orthodontic, and restorative approaches.\n\nConsolidating this information, a diastema is a space or gap between two teeth, commonly seen between the upper incisors and can be caused by various factors such as jaw and teeth size imbalance or the presence of a large labial frenum. This condition is not exclusive to humans and can be found in various species of mammals. Additionally, specific anatomical characteristics related to diastemata are present in certain prehistoric species. The presence of interdental gum and interdental papilla between the teeth is also relevant to understanding diastema.
