Understanding oestrus is important for determining the fertile period when cows may be artificially inseminated.\n\n2. \"AI\" (Artificial Insemination) - This is a technique used in breeding where semen is collected from bulls and stored for later use in inseminating cows. It is used to improve the quality of a herd, introduce new bloodlines, and allow breeding to higher-quality bulls.\n\n3. \"Cattle prods\" - These are electric prods used to move cattle, including bulls, out of chutes quickly. There is controversy around their use, with critics claiming they are used to injure and torture bulls.\n\n4. \"Bucking stock\" - Bulls are used in roughriding events, and stock contractors supply the various roughriding associations with bulls for these events. Contract stock has produced a more uniform range of bucking stock, which is also quieter to handle.\n\n5. \"Stockwhip\" - In Australia, a stockwhip is usually carried and used as needed when mustering cattle with horses. This may be an unfamiliar tool or concept for some readers.\n\nThese concepts and practices are important in understanding the role of bulls on a farm, including their use in breeding, roughriding events, and the various techniques and tools involved in handling and managing bulls on a farm.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",

They are essential for mating with female cows during their oestrus cycle, which is the period when they are fertile and ready for mating.\n\n2. Bulls are also used for artificial insemination (AI), where their semen is collected and stored for later use in inseminating cows. This technique helps improve the quality of the herd and introduces new bloodlines.\n\n3. In addition to breeding, bulls are also used for meat production. They are raised specifically for their meat, which is an important product for many farms.\n\n4. Bulls are sometimes used in roughriding events, where they serve as bucking stock. Stock contractors supply these events with bulls, and the handling and management of bulls for these events require specific techniques and tools, such as cattle prods and stockwhips.\n\nAnswer:\nBulls are used for breeding, artificial insemination, meat production, and as bucking stock for roughriding events on a farm.",
