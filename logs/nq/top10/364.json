        "anchoring_output": "The first European ship to sail around the tip of Africa was the S\u00e3o Gabriel, captained by Vasco da Gama. This historic voyage took place in 1497-1498, and it was a significant milestone in the Age of Discovery, as it opened up a sea route from Europe to Asia. Vasco da Gama's expedition was part of Portugal's efforts to establish direct trade with India and bypass the overland routes controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The successful navigation around the Cape of Good Hope and the subsequent establishment of trade links with India had a profound impact on global trade and European expansion. Therefore, Vasco da Gama is credited with captaining the first European ship to sail around the tip of Africa.",
