The Steelers missed the playoffs for the first time since 1991, finishing the season 7-9 after starting 5-2 and losing their last five games.\n2. The Steelers clinched the last AFC playoff spot with a 10-6 record, but lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional round.\n3. The Steelers ended their season 13-6 after losing a game, and Roethlisberger dropped to 3-2 in Conference Championship games.\n\nAnalyzing this information can help improve the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities by providing specific examples of cause and effect relationships. For example, the model can learn that a team missing the playoffs is a result of losing multiple games towards the end of the season, and that clinching a playoff spot is a result of achieving a certain win-loss record. Understanding these causal relationships can help the model make more accurate predictions and inferences about sports outcomes based on team performance.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to enhance the causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
