For example, it highlights the correlation between the size of an animal and its lifespan, with larger animals generally having longer lifespans. It also introduces the concept of reaching sexual maturity and its relationship to lifespan, as seen in the case of Greenland sharks.\n\nFurthermore, the information about the \"Nothobranchius furzeri\" vertebrate and the Brandt's bat challenges the general patterns of animal lifespans, prompting the model to consider outliers and exceptions to the established norms.
