The calf muscle is located in the back portion of the lower leg and corresponds to the posterior compartment of the leg. The two largest muscles within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and attach to the heel via the Achilles tendon. Several other, smaller muscles attach to the knee, the ankle, and via long tendons to the toes. The term \"musculus\" in Latin, which means \"little mouse\", is used to refer to muscles because a muscle looks like a little mouse that moves under the skin. This term can be traced back to Roman antiquity and is also found in the medical writings of Aulus Cornelius Celsus. The Ancient Greek word for \"mouse\", \u03bc\u1fe6\u03c2, is also used to refer to a muscle, showing the historical connection between the two languages.
