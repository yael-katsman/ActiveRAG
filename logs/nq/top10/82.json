It was officially adopted by the police in the 1900s.\n\nAnswer: Fingerprinting was first used by the police in the late 19th century.To provide the language model with relevant background and anchoring knowledge and concepts, helping it better understand the question.\n        I retrieved some knowledge that is may unfamiliar with the model: \n        knowledge:\n        1. The method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints was first introduced in the 1860s by Sir William James Herschel in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr. Henry Faulds in 1880. This information provides background on the origins of fingerprinting and the early proponents of its use in forensic work.\n\n2. The French scientist Paul-Jean Coulier developed a method to transfer latent fingerprints on surfaces to paper using iodine fuming, which allowed the London Scotland Yard to start fingerprinting individuals and identify criminals using fingerprints in 1901. This development played a crucial role in the adoption of fingerprint identification by law enforcement agencies.\n\n3. The Scheffer case of 1902 is the first case of the identification, arrest, and conviction of a murderer based upon fingerprint evidence. This case demonstrates the significant impact of fingerprinting in solving criminal cases and securing convictions based on forensic evidence.\n\n4. In 1880, Henry Faulds, a Scottish surgeon in a Tokyo hospital, published his first paper on the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposed a method to record them with printing ink. This highlights the early efforts to establish the practical application of fingerprinting for identification purposes.\n\n5. In 1892, Juan Vucetich, an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. This development marked a significant milestone in the establishment of systematic fingerprint records for law enforcement purposes.\n\n6. Francis Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification in his 1892 book \"Finger Prints,\" calculating the chance of a \"false positive\" in fingerprint identification. This statistical analysis contributed to the scientific associate of fingerprint identification and its acceptance by the courts.\n\nThese extracted contents provide historical background, key developments, and the role of individuals in the early adoption and advancement of fingerprinting for forensic and law enforcement purposes. Understanding these concepts and historical events is essential for analyzing the timeline and significance of fingerprinting in police work.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
