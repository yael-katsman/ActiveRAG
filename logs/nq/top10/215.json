The Radcliffe Line was determined by a British Government-commissioned report and sought to separate the Muslim-majority regions in the east and northwest from the areas with a Hindu majority. The boundary demarcation also involved the partition of two British provinces, Bengal and Punjab, which did not have a uniform majority.\n\nAdditionally, the Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh in 1974 and its revised version in 2015 resulted in the exchange of enclaves and simplification of the international border between the two countries.
