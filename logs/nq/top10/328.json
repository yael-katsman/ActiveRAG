This passage explains that idioventricular rhythm is a ventricular rhythm affecting the cardiac ventricle alone, and it refers to any ectopic ventricular arrhythmia. The passage also mentions that a heart rate of 131 falls within the range of accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which is between 40 and 120 beats per minute. This information is important for the model to understand the specific cardiac condition associated with a heart rate of 131.\n\nAdditionally, the passage about the Australian-led international study highlights the significance of heart rate as a key indicator for the risk of heart attack. It explains that patients with a heart rate above 70 beats per minute had a significantly higher incidence of heart attacks, hospital admissions, and the need for surgery. This information provides context for the model to understand the potential implications of a heart rate of 131 in relation to the risk of heart attack and cardiovascular disease.\n\nBy analyzing these contents, the model can gain a better understanding of the medical significance of a heart rate of 131 and its potential implications for cardiac health.
