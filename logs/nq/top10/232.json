The route became SR2 from the Illinois state line to Valparaiso, SR44 Valparaiso to Fort Wayne, and SR2 from Fort Wayne to the Ohio state line. In the early 1920s, the Lincoln Highway was moved south between Valparaiso and Fort Wayne, to what is now known mostly as Old US30, passing through Plymouth and Warsaw. The Lincoln Highway in Ohio became known as SR5 between Indiana state line and Mansfield, SR10 between Mansfield and Wooster, and SR5 between Wooster and Pennsylvania.

The route became SR 2 from the Ohio state line to South Bend, SR 1 from South Bend to the Michigan state line, and SR 2 from Fort Wayne to the Ohio state line. In Indiana, the Lincoln Highway passed through downtown Fort Wayne and was assigned the designation of Main Market route number 2 in 1917.
