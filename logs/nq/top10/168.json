This scale was originally known as the centigrade scale, but was later renamed to honor Celsius's contributions to the field of thermometry. The Celsius scale is now widely used in scientific and everyday contexts for measuring temperature. The switch from \"centigrade\" to \"Celsius\" in weather forecasts by the BBC in 1985 further solidified the use of the term in informal settings. Therefore, the origin of the word \"Celsius\" is directly linked to the pioneering work of Anders Celsius in developing the temperature scale that bears his name.",
