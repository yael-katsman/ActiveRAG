Its main function is to store and concentrate bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver. When food containing fat enters the digestive tract, a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK) is released, which signals the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of fats.\n\nAdditionally, in some cases, the gallbladder may need to be removed due to conditions such as gallstones or inflammation. After gallbladder removal, bile flows directly from the liver into the small intestine, which can lead to changes in digestion and the need for dietary adjustments.\n\nAnswer:\nThe gallbladder is situated in the human body on the right side of the abdomen, near the liver.
