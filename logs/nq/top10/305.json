        "anchoring_output": "Enhanced reasoning process:\nThe major countries involved in the Cold War were the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, along with their respective allies. The Cold War was characterized by the division of the world into the Eastern Bloc, led by the Soviet Union, and the Western Bloc, led by the United States. The Soviet Union had control and influence over Eastern European countries such as Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, forming the Eastern Bloc. On the other hand, the United States led the formation of military alliances like NATO, which included countries such as West Germany and supported anti-Soviet efforts in countries like South Korea.\n\nAdditionally, China played a significant role in the Cold War, especially after the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949. The involvement of China added another dimension to the geopolitical tensions, as it aligned with the Soviet Union for a period before diverging and pursuing its own foreign policy agenda.\n\nFurthermore, the development of nuclear weapons by countries other than the United States and the Soviet Union, such as the United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, and France, added to the complexity of the Cold War dynamics. These countries became part of the nuclear arms race, further intensifying the global standoff.\n\nAnswer:\nThe major countries involved in the Cold War were the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, along with their respective allies. The division of the world into the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, the control and influence of the Soviet Union over Eastern European countries, the formation of military alliances like NATO, and the development of nuclear weapons by additional countries all contributed to the major players and dynamics of the Cold War.",
