The concept of \"Autopistas\" as toll roads built and funded by Federal taxes in Mexico.\n2. The numbering system for Mexican highways, where odd numbers are assigned to north-south highways and even numbers to east-west highways, with toll expressways having the letter \"D\" added to their number.\n3. The operation of toll highways by companies such as Autopistas Michoac\u00e1n and Caminos y Puentes Federales, including the specific toll charges for different highways.\n4. The historical background of the Mexican toll road network, including the role of state-owned companies like Caminos Federales de Ingresos, S.A. de C.V. in building and maintaining toll highways.\n5. The concept of a \"spur\" highway, such as Federal Highway 160D, which functions as a branch or extension of another highway (in this case, Mexican Federal Highway 95D).\n\nAnalysis:\nUnderstanding the unfamiliar content from the passages can provide the model with background knowledge about the structure, funding, and operation of toll roads in Mexico. It also introduces the model to specific companies involved in managing toll highways and the historical development of the toll road network.

They are built to nearly identical standards as the US Interstate Highways System. Many states in Mexico also have their own toll roads, such as Puebla, Veracruz, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Mexican highways are assigned a one to three-digit number, with odd numbers for north-south highways and even numbers for east-west highways. Toll expressways usually run parallel to a free road and are assigned the same number with the letter \"D\" added. Most autopistas have a toll over all or part of their length, and some are two-lane roads. The toll roads are operated by various entities and charge different toll amounts for travel.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge about toll roads in Mexico includes the fact that they are called \"autopistas\" and are built and funded by federal taxes. They are built to similar standards as the US Interstate Highways System. Additionally, the information provides advanced knowledge about the numbering system for Mexican highways, the parallel structure of toll expressways, and the different entities that operate the toll roads.
