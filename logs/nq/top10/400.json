It provides sensation to the skin of the foot and the entire lower leg, except for the inner side. The tibial nerve, a branch of the sciatic nerve, supplies sensation to the sole of the foot, while the common fibular nerve supplies sensation to the lower leg and upper surface of the foot.\n\nThe sciatic nerve is formed from the L4 to S3 segments of the sacral plexus, and it contains fibers from both the anterior and posterior divisions of the lumbosacral plexus. It passes beneath the piriformis muscle and through the greater sciatic foramen, exiting the pelvis and traveling down the posterior thigh to the popliteal fossa. At the popliteal fossa, the nerve divides into its two branches: the superficial fibular nerve or peroneal nerve, which innervates the dorsal aspect of the foot, and the tibial nerve, which innervates the plantar surface of the foot.\n\nInjuries or disorders affecting the lower back, such as lumbar disc herniations, can compress the nerve roots and cause pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve down into the foot, a condition known as sciatica. Additionally, a herniation in the lumbar region can also affect the femoral nerve, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the hips, legs, and feet.\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy and function of the sciatic nerve is crucial for diagnosing and treating conditions such as sciatica and other lower back-related issues.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\n        comprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
