It involves the implementation of austerity measures or other conditions in exchange for receiving IMF assistance.\n\n2. \"SDR477 billion\" - This is the amount of funds in the pool contributed by countries through a quota system, from which countries experiencing balance of payments problems can borrow money from the IMF.\n\n3. \"surveillance\" - The IMF's activity of monitoring the economic and financial policies of its member countries to facilitate international cooperation and oversee members' policies.\n\n4. \"macroeconomic stability\" - This refers to the overall stability of an economy, including low inflation, low unemployment, and steady economic growth. The IMF works with developing nations to help them achieve macroeconomic stability and reduce poverty.\n\n5. \"market imperfections\" - Refers to the idea that private international capital markets do not function perfectly, and many countries have limited access to financial markets. This justifies the need for official financing from institutions like the IMF to correct large external payment imbalances.\n\n6. \"United Nations system\" - The IMF is part of the United Nations system and has a formal relationship agreement with the UN, but it retains its independence. This indicates that the IMF works in collaboration with the UN on monetary cooperation and financial stability issues.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
