It mentions that Mass was said in Latin until around 1964 when Vatican II's directives came into effect. It also explains that from 1964 onwards, there was a series of documents from Rome granting general authorization for greater proportions of the Mass to be said in the vernacular, and by 1970, priests were no longer obliged to use Latin in any part of the Mass. Additionally, it highlights that in 2007, Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the 1962 Mass of John XXIII and the 1970 Mass of Paul VI are two forms of the same Roman Rite, with the former being an \"extraordinary form\" and the latter being the \"normal form\" of the Eucharistic Liturgy.\n\nThe selected information can enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities by providing a clear historical context and sequence of events leading to the transition from Latin to vernacular languages in the celebration of the Mass. This historical context can help the model understand the cause-and-effect relationship between Vatican II's directives, the authorization for greater use of vernacular languages, and the eventual discontinuation of the obligation to use Latin in the Mass. Additionally, the clarification by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 provides a nuanced understanding of the two forms of the Roman Rite, which can further enhance the model's logical inference capabilities in understanding the current practices related to the use of Latin in the Mass.
