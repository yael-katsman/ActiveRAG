These structures are believed to have been primarily used as burial sites and are found in various regions of Europe, including France, Malta, England, Scandinavia, Germany, and Italy. The megalithic tradition in Europe dates back to the Neolithic and Copper Ages, with structures such as Stonehenge in England and large ceremonial complexes in eastern Turkey being notable examples. The spread of megalithic architecture in Europe also involved the importation of cultural aspects from the Atlantic world, particularly in regions like Sardinia and Sicily. Additionally, the presence of megalithic structures in specific areas of Germany and Poland reflects the variations in style and distribution of these architectural elements in Western Europe.\n\nAnalysis:\nBy extracting and consolidating this information, the model can deepen its understanding of the prevalence and distribution of portal tombs as the most common form of megalithic architecture in Europe. It can also gain insight into the cultural and historical significance of these structures, as well as their role in the spread of megalithic traditions across different regions. Furthermore, the model can expand its knowledge of specific examples of megalithic architecture, such as Stonehenge and the ceremonial complexes in eastern Turkey, and their contribution to the overall understanding of megalithic traditions in Europe.
