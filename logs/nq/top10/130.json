        "anchoring_output": "Enhanced reasoning process using retrieved knowledge:\nDaylight saving time has a complex history in the United States, with variations in observance and regional proposals for alternative time standards. For example, before 2006, Indiana unofficially observed daylight saving time in certain counties, leading to a debate and controversy over its adoption. Additionally, there have been proposals for some states in New England to adopt year-round \"Atlantic Standard Time\" and opt out of observing daylight saving time. The lack of federal law on daylight saving time from 1945 to 1966 allowed localities to choose their own observance, contributing to the diverse practices across different states.\n\nFurthermore, Arizona does not observe daylight saving time, except for the Navajo Nation in the northeastern part of the state, which does observe it. This exception adds to the complexity of daylight saving time observance within a single state. Additionally, the Nevada Senate passed a resolution urging Congress to allow individual states to establish daylight saving time as the standard time throughout the year, indicating ongoing discussions and potential changes in the observance of DST.\n\nAnswer:\nThe states that do not allow daylight saving time are Hawaii and Arizona (except for the Navajo Nation), and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.
