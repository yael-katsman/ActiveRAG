The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. The pH of a solution is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution, and solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic.\n\nThe advanced information includes the role of bases in the pH scale, with bases having a pH greater than 7. The pH of bases is usually calculated using the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) to find the pOH first. Strong bases have a lower H concentration and a higher OH concentration, leading to a larger self-ionization constant (K) and a higher pH. The role of weak bases in titration is also mentioned, with the end-point occurring at a pH greater than 7.\n\nConsolidating this information, we can understand that the highest base on the pH scale would have a pH greater than 7, with a lower concentration of hydrogen ions and a higher concentration of hydroxide ions.

Bases with a higher pH have a lower concentration of hydrogen ions and a higher concentration of hydroxide ions.\n\nIn more advanced terms, the pH of a base is calculated using the concentration of hydroxide ions to find the pOH first, and then converting it to pH using the formula pH = 14 - pOH.

Weak bases also play a role in titration, with the end-point occurring at a pH greater than 7.\n\nThe highest base on the pH scale would have a pH of 14, representing the most basic or alkaline substance.
