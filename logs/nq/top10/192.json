Members of the society advocated for healthy, comfortable, and beautiful clothing, and sought to eliminate tightly-fitting corsets, high-heeled shoes, and heavily-weighted skirts. The society also opposed crinolines and crinolettes, and promoted the idea of dressing in a way that contributes to health, comfort, and beauty as a duty to oneself and others.\n\nIn 1889, Charlotte Carmichael Stopes, a member of the Rational Dress Society, made a significant impact by introducing the concept of rational dress at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. This impromptu addition to the program garnered widespread attention in the media, bringing the notion of rational dress to the forefront.\n\nThe movement for rational dress gained momentum and influenced women's fashion, particularly in the context of the bicycle craze, which led to the adoption of more practical and liberating clothing such as bloomers.
