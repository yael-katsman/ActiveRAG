This has led to large-scale issues such as the division of ethnic groups and small-scale issues like families' homes being separated from their farms.\n\nFurthermore, the Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently, proclaiming any changes as illegitimate, which has led to the consensus among African leaders to maintain these borders, despite their arbitrary nature.\n\nThe information provided deepens the understanding of how Africa's country borders were created and the implications of these borders on the continent's geopolitical and social landscape.
