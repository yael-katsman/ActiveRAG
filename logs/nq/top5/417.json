        "anchoring_output": "Enhanced reasoning process with retrieved knowledge:\n\n1. The use of Latin in the Catholic Mass was widespread for many centuries, dating back to the early days of the Church when Latin was the language of the Roman Empire.\n\n2. The Second Vatican Council, also known as Vatican II, was a significant event in the history of the Catholic Church, taking place from 1962 to 1965. One of the key changes initiated by Vatican II was the allowance for the use of vernacular languages in the Mass, rather than exclusively using Latin.\n\n3. Following Vatican II, the transition from Latin to the vernacular languages in the Mass began to take place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This transition was a response to the Council's directives and aimed to make the Mass more accessible and understandable to the faithful.\n\n4. The publication of the revised Roman Missal in 1970 further solidified the shift towards using the vernacular languages in the Mass, as it provided the official liturgical texts in the languages of the various regions where the Mass was celebrated.\n\n5. While the use of Latin in the Mass declined significantly after Vatican II, it's important to note that the Latin Mass, also known as the Tridentine Mass, continued to be celebrated in some places and by certain groups of Catholics who preferred the traditional form of the liturgy.\n\nAnswer:\nThe use of Latin in the Catholic Mass began to decline, and the transition to vernacular languages took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s, following the directives of the Second Vatican Council.",

Today, a majority of Masses are celebrated in the language of the people, but Latin is still used occasionally or in some places on a regular basis.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge extracted from the passages includes the historical practice of saying mass in Latin, the changes brought about by Vatican II's directives, and the subsequent authorization for greater use of the vernacular in the Mass. The advanced information includes the specific timeline of when priests were no longer obliged to use Latin in any part of the Mass and the current practice of celebrating Mass in the language of the people, with Latin still being used occasionally or in some places on a regular basis.\n\nBy understanding these associateal and advanced pieces of information, the model can deepen its understanding of when the practice of saying mass in Latin stopped and how it evolved over time.

The directives of Vatican II in 1964 marked a significant turning point, leading to the expansion of the use of vernacular languages in the Mass. Bishops' Conferences from around the world played a crucial role in this transition by voting to adopt the vernacular and seeking confirmation from Rome. Subsequently, a series of documents from Rome granted authorization for increasing portions of the Mass to be said in the vernacular.
