This region was chosen for the expertise of its African farmers in rice cultivation and technology, which they brought to early America. The knowledge and technical skills of these African farmers in designing and building earthworks, irrigation systems, and rice cultivation techniques played a significant role in making rice one of the most lucrative industries in early America.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of colonization on the population of Belgian Congo, with a reported 50% population decline under Congo Free State rule due to forced labor, massacre by colonial troops, famine, and disease, is also unfamiliar to the model. The forced expropriation of fertile lands from indigenous populations for use by white settlers in countries like Algeria, Kenya, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Southwest Africa, as well as the push of African farmers onto \"native reserves\" located on arid, marginal lands, is also unfamiliar.\n\nThese unfamiliar contents provide background knowledge on the specific regions of Africa involved in colonization and the impact of colonization on the indigenous populations, including forced labor, land expropriation, and population decline.

These Africans were experts in rice cultivation and its technology, having been growing indigenous African rice for thousands of years and being familiar with Asian rice as well. They brought their knowledge and technical skills to develop extensive rice cultivation in early America.\n\nAdvanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the specific areas of Africa that were involved in colonization, such as the tribes around the Kwango river in the south-west and the U\u00e9l\u00e9 in the north-east. Additionally, the Belgian government commissions in the 1920s found that the population of Belgian Congo had fallen by as much as 50% under Congo Free State rule as a result of forced labor, massacre by colonial troops, famine, and disease. In white settler colonies like Algeria, Kenya, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa, and Southwest Africa (now Namibia), the most fertile lands were forcibly expropriated from the indigenous populations for use by white settlers, and African farmers were pushed onto \"native reserves,\" usually located on arid, marginal lands. Slavery was also widely abolished by colonial powers.\n\nAnalyzing the role of these contents, it is evident that the colonization of Africa involved the exploitation of indigenous populations for labor and resources, as well as the forced displacement of African farmers from fertile lands to less desirable areas. This led to significant population declines, forced labor, and other atrocities inflicted upon the African people by the colonial powers.
