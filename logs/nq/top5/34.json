In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver. It receives and stores bile produced by the liver and releases it into the duodenum to aid in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder is connected to the liver through bile ducts, and the release of bile is triggered by the presence of fat in the duodenum, stimulated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK).\n\nAdvanced information includes the role of the gallbladder in processing fats in the body and the potential consequences of its removal, such as the need for careful dietary considerations and the possibility of experiencing diarrhea. Additionally, the passages mention cirrhosis, a complication of liver diseases that can lead to abnormal liver structure and function, resulting in a high rate of deaths.\n\nOverall, the associateal knowledge includes the anatomical location and function of the gallbladder, while the advanced information delves into the consequences of gallbladder removal and the potential complications of liver diseases.
