Its massive area is comparable to the size of China or the United States. The desert's location in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge creates a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure, leading to a steady descending airflow that causes warming and drying effects in the upper troposphere. This prevents evaporating water from rising and makes cloud formation extremely difficult.\n\nThe Sahara Desert also played a crucial role in African trade during the 14th century, as much of the trade revolved around the Trans-Saharan trade routes. Despite being viewed as a barrier between African countries, the desert actually linked them together rather than separating them.\n\nBy consolidating this information, the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities can be improved by understanding the environmental and geographical factors that contribute to the Sahara Desert's significance. This can help the model make connections between the desert's size, location, and climatic effects, as well as its historical and economic impact on African trade.
