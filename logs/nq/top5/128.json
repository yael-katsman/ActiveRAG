It is part of the \"S. burkei\" species complex and has a small population of around 250 adult trees. \n- Senegalia caffra, also known as hook-thorn or Acacia caffra, is a commonly occurring tree in southern Africa, including in Gauteng suburban gardens. \n- The knobthorn (Senegalia nigrescens) is a deciduous African tree found in savanna regions from West Africa to South Africa. It is resistant to drought but not frost, and its wood is resistant to termites. \n- Senegalia mellifera is a common thorn tree in Africa, known for its sweet-smelling blossoms and honey. It is also referred to as Blackthorn and Swarthaak in Afrikaans. \n- Erythrina lysistemon is a deciduous tree native to South Africa, commonly known as the common coral tree or lucky bean tree. \n\nAdvanced information:\n- The Senegalia montis-salinarum is part of the \"S. burkei\" species complex, indicating its taxonomical classification within the Senegalia genus. \n- The knobthorn tree, Senegalia nigrescens, plays a significant ecological role as it is browsed on by giraffes and other mammals, including elephants. \n- Senegalia mellifera is known for its pitch-black lumber when oiled, in addition to its sweet-smelling blossoms and honey. \n\nAnalysis:\nBy consolidating the associateal knowledge and advanced information, the model can deepen its understanding of the South African tree with thorns on the trunk.
