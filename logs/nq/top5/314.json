This includes the fact that before 1973, cards were issued in local Social Security offices and the area number represented the office code where the card was issued. Additionally, the process of assigning the first Social Security number in history to John David Sweeney, Jr., of New Rochelle, New York, and the geographical location of the first three digits of the social security numbers assigned in the United States and its territories from 1973 until June 25, 2011 may also be unfamiliar.\n\nUnderstanding this historical process and the geographical allocation of Social Security numbers can provide the model with relevant background knowledge about the development and administration of Social Security numbers.

The first three digits or area number were initially assigned based on geographical region, but after 1973, they were assigned based on the ZIP Code in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The process of assigning Social Security numbers has evolved over time, with changes in the issuance and centralization of cards.
