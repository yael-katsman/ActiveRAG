From 2009 to 2012, the UK reformed its corporate tax code, introducing a lower 19% corporate tax rate and moving to a full \"territorial tax system\". Before the 2012 budget, the rate of corporation tax in the UK was 26%, and in 2013, it was further reduced to 20%. These reductions were offset by the bank levy. The UK's decision to reform its corporate tax code and reduce the tax rate resulted in the return of many outstanding UK inversions from the 2007-2010 period, indicating the effectiveness of the tax reforms.\n\nThe selected information can enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities by providing a clear example of how changes in corporate tax rates and tax code reforms can impact the behavior of businesses and the overall economy. By understanding the cause-and-effect relationship between tax reforms and the return of businesses to the UK, the model can develop a better understanding of how policy changes can influence corporate decisions and economic outcomes. This can improve the model's ability to make logical inferences about the potential effects of tax policies and other regulatory changes on businesses and the economy as a whole.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to enhance the causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
