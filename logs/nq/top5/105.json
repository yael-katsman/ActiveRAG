This information contradicts the model's existing knowledge if it assumes that healthcare in the UK is completely free for all individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the passage about the E112 European health scheme ruling in 2006 states that UK health authorities had to pay the bill if a patient could establish urgent medical reasons for seeking quicker treatment in another European Union country.
