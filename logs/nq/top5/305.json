Additionally, Sweden played a role of major importance despite not officially participating, and had strong defensive power. The Soviets absorbed the Baltic nations and had control over Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria. The formation of NATO in 1949 included most of the nations of Western Europe and Canada, strengthening the alliance against the Soviet bloc. The United States' failure to negotiate a settlement between nationalist China and the Communists led to the Communists taking over China in 1949. Furthermore, the development of nuclear weapons by the United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, and France during the early Cold War years added to the complexity of the geopolitical situation. American soldiers were also present in countries like West Germany and South Korea during the Cold War, further highlighting the global nature of the conflict.\n\nAnswer:\nThe major countries involved in the Cold War were the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and their respective allies, with Sweden playing a significant role despite not officially participating.",
