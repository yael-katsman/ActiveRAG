        "anchoring_output": "The reasoning process is accurate, and the retrieved knowledge provides essential background information for understanding the Greek god who flew too close to the sun.\n\nEnhanced reasoning process:\nThe story of Icarus, the Greek god who flew too close to the sun, is a well-known myth from ancient Greek mythology. It is part of the larger narrative involving the skilled craftsman Daedalus and his son Icarus, who attempted to escape from Crete using wings made of feathers and wax. Despite his father's warnings, Icarus flew too close to the sun, causing the wax on his wings to melt and leading to his tragic downfall. This myth serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of hubris and disobedience.\n\nThe mention of the Eternals, Olympian gods, and their alliance with humans is not directly relevant to the story of Icarus, as it pertains to a different aspect of Greek mythology. However, it does provide insight into the broader context of ancient Greek religious beliefs and the interactions between gods and mortals.\n\nThe tension between the traditional religious veneration of Helios and the Ionian proto-scientific examination of the sun sheds light on the cultural and philosophical significance of the sun god in ancient Greece. This context enriches the understanding of the myth of Icarus, as it highlights the importance of celestial deities in ancient Greek society.\n\nThe reference to the trial of Anaxagoras and his assertion about the nature of the sun as a gigantic red-hot ball of metal introduces the concept of early scientific inquiry and the clash between scientific knowledge and traditional religious beliefs. While this historical context is fascinating, it is not directly related to the myth of Icarus and his flight towards the sun.\n\nAnswer:\nThe Greek god who flew too close to the sun is Icarus.",
