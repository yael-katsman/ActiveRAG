Additionally, Schoenberg was known for extending the traditionally opposed German Romantic styles of Brahms and Wagner and for embracing ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.\n\nConsolidating this information, we can understand that Arnold Schoenberg abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition as an alternative to the diatonic system. His method involved using a series of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale to create compositions, and he was influential in extending German Romantic styles and developing motifs without a centralized melodic idea.
