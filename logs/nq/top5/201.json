These alliances played significant roles in shaping European diplomacy and military strategy during their respective time periods. The Franco-Russian Alliance was formed due to common foreign policy and mutual strategic military interests between France and Russia, while the Holy Alliance aimed to restrain liberalism and secularism in Europe. The Anglo-French Alliance was part of the stately quadrille of Great Powers in Europe, and the Franco-Ottoman Alliance was the first non-ideological diplomatic alliance between a Christian and non-Christian empire.
