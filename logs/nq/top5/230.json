In long bones, the primary centers occur in the diaphysis/shaft, while in irregular bones, the primary centers occur in the body of the bone. Most bones have only one primary center, but some irregular bones have multiple primary centers. Secondary ossification centers appear after the primary ossification center, mostly during the postnatal and adolescent years, and they appear in the epiphyses of long bones. Endochondral ossification begins with primary ossification centers in the cartilage, which mostly appear during fetal development. These primary ossification centers are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones, and certain parts of irregular bones. Secondary ossification occurs after birth and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. At skeletal maturity, all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge about primary ossification centers is that they appear during prenatal development in the central part of each developing bone, and they are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones, and certain parts of irregular bones. The advanced information includes the timing of appearance of secondary ossification centers, the process of endochondral ossification, and the eventual fusion of the diaphysis and both epiphyses at skeletal maturity.
