Osiris replaced the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaoh's subjects, and the cult of Osiris became increasingly significant during this time. The Pyramid Texts found in Unas' pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time, with both gods believed to play key roles in accessing the afterlife. Additionally, the cult of the sun god Ra was in apparent decline during this period, despite Ra still being the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon. The influence of temples expanded during the New Kingdom, and the most important god of the time was Amun, whose main cult center at Karnak in Thebes became the largest of all temples. The elevation of Amun was partly due to the great importance of Thebes and the increasingly professional priesthood. Therefore, the model can benefit from understanding the significance of Osiris and the changing religious landscape during the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
