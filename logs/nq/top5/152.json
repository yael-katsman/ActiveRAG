Therefore, the sun hits the eastern part of the United States first.\n\nAnswer:\nThe sun hits the eastern part of the United States first.To provide the language model with relevant background and anchoring knowledge and concepts, helping it better understand the question.\n        I retrieved some knowledge that is may unfamiliar with the model: \n        knowledge:\n        The content that may be unfamiliar to the model includes:\n\n1. The claim that Katahdin is the first place in the United States mainland to receive sunlight in the morning, but this is incorrect, and other mountains, lower in elevation but farther to the east or southeast, depending on the season, see the first sunrise of the day. This challenges the common belief and introduces the concept of how the position and elevation of mountains can affect the timing of sunrise.\n\n2. The mention of the peak being traditionally regarded as the first land in the world to catch the rays of the new day's sun, but this claim is open to interpretation. It also discusses the tilt of the Earth's axis and how it affects the timing of sunrise in different places. This introduces the concept of how the Earth's tilt and rotation impact the timing of sunrise, and the idea that traditional beliefs may not always be accurate.\n\n3. The information about some bases in Antarctica, particularly the South Pole and McMurdo Station, being the first in the world to see the sun at New Year, since the sun is up at midnight at that time of the year. This introduces the concept of how the position of the South Pole and the unique phenomenon of the sun being up at midnight during certain times of the year.\n\nAnalyzing the role of these contents:\nThese contents provide background knowledge about the timing of sunrise in different locations and the factors that influence it, such as the position of mountains, the tilt of the Earth's axis, and the unique phenomenon at the South Pole. Understanding these concepts is important for accurately answering the question about where the sun hits the US first, as it requires knowledge of how geographical and astronomical factors affect the timing of sunrise in different locations.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",

The timing of sunrise can also be influenced by geographical features such as mountains and the tilt of the Earth's axis.\n\nAnswer:\nThe sun hits the eastern part of the United States first, with locations such as Cadillac Mountain in Maine and other eastern coastal areas experiencing the sunrise before the rest of the country.

It also mentions that in summer, due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, it does receive the sun's rays earlier than some places, but not earlier than the Chatham Islands or Antarctica.\n\nConsolidating this information, it is important to understand that the first place in the United States to receive sunlight in the morning is not necessarily Katahdin, as other mountains farther to the east or southeast may see the first sunrise of the day depending on the season. Additionally, in Antarctica, the South Pole and McMurdo Station are the first places in the world to see the sun at New Year, as the sun is up at midnight at that time of the year.
