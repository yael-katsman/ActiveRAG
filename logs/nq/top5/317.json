The poverty threshold in the U.S. is updated each year by the U.S. Census Bureau and is adjusted for inflation to reflect the cost of living in different areas.\n2. The percentage of individuals below the poverty line had risen to 13.8% by 2007, according to estimates from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey program.\n3. A large proportion of poor people are actually working or looking for work, with 58.9% of poor families and 33% of poor unrelated individuals being part of the working poor.\n4. The cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 for a middle-income, two-parent family averaged $226,920 in the previous year, not including college expenses.\n5. Studies show that the public overestimates the number of African Americans living below the poverty line, with the actual percentage being less than a quarter.\n\nAnalyzing the role of these contents:\n1. The information about the annual adjustment of the poverty threshold and the factors considered in this adjustment provides background knowledge about how poverty is measured in the U.S.\n2. The data on the rising percentage of individuals below the poverty line in 2007 gives historical context and shows the trend of poverty over time.\n3. The insight into the working poor population challenges the common misconception that poverty is solely linked to joblessness.\n4. The cost of raising a child highlights the financial challenges faced by families living near or below the poverty line.\n5. The information about public perceptions of poverty, particularly related to African Americans, sheds light on the influence of media and societal biases on understanding poverty.\n\nBy understanding these unfamiliar concepts, the model can better comprehend the complexities of poverty in the U.S. and the various factors that contribute to it, leading to a more informed analysis of the percentage of the U.S. population living below the poverty line.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
