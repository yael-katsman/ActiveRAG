Additionally, the Battle of Britain Memorial is located at Capel-le-Ferne, near Folkestone, on the coast of Kent, and it serves as a monument to the aircrew who flew in the Battle of Britain. The region of Kent played a significant role in the Battle of Britain, with RAF Bomber Command based at High Wycombe and RAF Medmenham at Danesfield House in Buckinghamshire being important for aerial reconnaissance. The RAF also established numerous fighter stations in Kent during World War II, such as Biggin Hill, Gravesend, West Malling, Hawkinge, and Lympne. Additionally, the model should be familiar with the closure of RAF bases in Kent in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to post-Cold War defense cuts and the populated nature of the region.
