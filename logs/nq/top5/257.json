These structures, often known as \"dolmens,\" are believed to have been primarily used as burial sites during the Neolithic and late Stone Age periods. The megalithic structures in the northwest of France are considered the oldest in Europe based on radiocarbon dating. Additionally, Nordic megalith architecture, primarily found in Scandinavia and North Germany, emerged between 3500 and 2800 BC and was a product of the Funnelbeaker culture. The architectural style involves large slabs of stone arranged to form various structures such as dolmens, passage graves, and stone cists. Furthermore, large ceremonial complexes with carved megalithic orthostats have been discovered in eastern Turkey, dating back to the 9th millennium BC, but it is unclear if any European megalithic traditions are derived from them.\n\nThis associateal and advanced knowledge provides a comprehensive understanding of the most common form of megalithic architecture in Europe, including its historical and cultural significance. It deepens the model's understanding by familiarizing it with basic information about portal tombs and advanced details about the emergence of Nordic megalith architecture and the discovery of ceremonial complexes in eastern Turkey.
