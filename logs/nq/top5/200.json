Spinal fusion is a neurosurgical or orthopedic surgical technique that joins two or more vertebrae.\n2. The procedure can be performed at any level in the spine (cervical, thoracic, or lumbar) and prevents any movement between the fused vertebrae.\n3. Different types of spinal fusion involve using bone grafting from the patient, donor, or artificial bone substitutes to help the bones heal together.\n4. Additional hardware such as screws, plates, or cages is often used to hold the bones in place while the graft fuses the vertebrae together.\n5. Spinal fusion may be required for patients with advanced cases of vertebral osteomyelitis to destroy the microorganism causing the disease and rebuild parts of the spine that were lost due to the infection.\n6. Spinal fusions involve cleaning the infected area of the spine and inserting instrumentation to stabilize the vertebrae and disc(s).\n7. Bone grafts harvested from other areas of the body or from a bone bank, where bone fragments are harvested from deceased donors, are used in spinal fusion.\n8. Supporting rods and screws, most of which are made from titanium, are used to secure the new bone graft in the appropriate spinal region.\n9.
