The unsanitary and overcrowded City of London had suffered from numerous outbreaks of the plague over the centuries, but the Great Plague of 1665-1666 is remembered as the most significant. The plague flared up dramatically in June 1665, with a significant increase in fatalities. The outbreak led to around 60,000 deaths, which was one fifth of the population at the time.
