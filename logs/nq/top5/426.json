It can happen when there is an unequal relationship between the size of the teeth and the jaw. The condition is also referred to as \"gap tooth\" and can be caused by the presence of a large labial frenum from the upper lip extending near the teeth.

It also highlights the potential causes and treatment options for the condition. By understanding these details, the model can improve its causal reasoning and logical inference abilities by recognizing the relationship between unequal tooth size and jaw, as well as the impact of a large labial frenum on the development of diastema.
