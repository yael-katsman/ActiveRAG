This concept is based on the 1983 Code of Canon Law and is not necessarily established or recommended by Church authorities.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge is the Islamic concept of the fellowship of faith for the Muslims, which emphasizes the equality between individuals and the necessity of reforming between religious brothers.
