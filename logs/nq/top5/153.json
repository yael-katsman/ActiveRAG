This is because the uncertainty in measurement can cause stars at both closer and farther distances to appear at the given parallax, but there will be more stars in the volume shells at farther distances. This leads to a systematic bias in measured parallax towards a value larger than the true parallax, causing inferred luminosities and distances to be too small. The existence of this bias and the necessity of correcting for it has become relevant in astronomy with the precision parallax measurements made by satellites like Hipparcos and Gaia.\n\nAdditionally, the historical perspective provided by Aristarchus' belief that stars are very far away and the rejection of the heliocentric view due to the unobservability of stellar parallax also supports the idea that parallax is more pronounced with distant stars.\n\nBy consolidating this information, the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities can be improved by understanding the factors that contribute to the pronounced parallax with distant stars, such as the systematic bias in measured parallax and the historical context of stellar parallax observations.

The uncertainty in parallax measurements can cause both nearby and distant stars to appear at the given parallax, leading to a systematic bias towards a value larger than the true parallax. This can affect the inferred luminosities and distances of stars, posing a problem for astronomers trying to measure distance.\n\n2. The Hipparcos parallax and proper motions of stars can imply a much closer, and hence less luminous, star, which may contradict the model's existing knowledge of their distances and luminosities.\n\n3. Parallax measurements of stars can yield unexpected results, such as a star being unexpectedly close for its spectral type and brightness, or contradictory distance results for the same star.\n\n4. The rejection of the heliocentric view in ancient times was based on the assumption that stellar parallax was unobservable due to the stars being much farther away than generally assumed.
