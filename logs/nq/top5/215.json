        "anchoring_output": "knowledge enhanced reasoning process:\nThe boundary line between India and Bangladesh is a result of historical and legal processes. After the partition of India in 1947, the Radcliffe Line was drawn to demarcate the boundary between India and East Pakistan (which later became Bangladesh). This line was based on various factors, including religious demographics and geographical considerations. Additionally, the Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh in 1974 led to the resolution of complex issues such as enclaves and the establishment of a clear boundary line. The mid-channel flow principle, based on the thalweg doctrine, was used to determine the international boundary on river borders between the two countries, as established by the Radcliffe Award. This principle considers the main navigational channel of a river as the boundary line. Therefore, the boundary line between India and Bangladesh is known as the India-Bangladesh International Border, based on these historical and legal frameworks.\n\nAnswer:\nIndia-Bangladesh International Border",
