Understanding the historical context, it's important to note that Hawaii was a territory of the United States for many years before achieving statehood. The process of Hawaii becoming a state involved a series of events, including the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, annexation by the United States, and eventual statehood. This historical background helps us understand the significance of Hawaii's statehood in the context of U.S. history.\n\nAnswer:\nHawaii became a state on August 21, 1959. This was the culmination of a long process that involved significant historical events and marked the final addition of a state to the United States.",
