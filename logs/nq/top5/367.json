The clear text headers contain identifying information about the file type, and tools like Transmogrify can change the header information to obfuscate the file type. Additionally, the passages mention the use of printable ASCII characters and line feeds in the headers, which allows an archive containing only text files to appear as a text file itself. Furthermore, the role of headers in email messages is discussed, including the structured fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and the separation of the header from the body by a blank line.\n\nThis associateal knowledge about clear text headers in different file types and the role of headers in email messages provides a basic understanding of the information displayed in clear text from the FTP header.
