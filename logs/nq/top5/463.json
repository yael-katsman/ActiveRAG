The last major eruptions were in 1995-1996, with minor eruptions occurring frequently, including one in 2006. The volcano is composed mainly of andesite and has been erupting for at least 250,000 years. The eruptions have resulted in the formation of a warm acidic crater lake, which can be completely expelled during major eruptions. Additionally, the volcano has been the cause of lahars (mudflows) that have resulted in disasters, such as the Tangiwai disaster in 1953. Despite the current phase of volcano unrest appearing to be over, Mount Ruapehu remains an active volcano, and future eruptions may occur without warning.\n\nThis information provides a associateal understanding of the frequency and impact of Mount Ruapehu's eruptions, as well as the geological composition of the volcano. It also introduces advanced knowledge about the specific events and consequences of the eruptions, such as the formation of the crater lake and the occurrence of lahars.
