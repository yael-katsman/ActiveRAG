The show has been renewed for its seventh and eighth seasons, with the seventh season set to premiere on September 26, 2019. The role of Mom is played by Marsha Crenshaw in episodes 1\u201314 and the webisode, and by Joanna Daniel in episodes 15\u201328. The character is portrayed as a creature of the same \"species\" as Brak, with the fashions of a housewife character on a 1950s sitcom. She is largely the only semi-sane character on the show and displays little romantic or sexual interest in Brak's father. However, when she gets drunk, she finds him suddenly irresistible. The character is an homage to June Cleaver and similar motherly characters, with occasional hints of discontent with her husband's laziness and sexism. When Joanna Daniel took over the role, Brak's mother inexplicably acquired a British accent and became far more open in her discontent with domestic life and her annoyance with and disdain for Brak's father.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\n        comprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
