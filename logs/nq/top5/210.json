When packaged, the segments are stuck together firmly in the centre; therefore, prior to unwrapping, the ball is traditionally tapped severely on a hard surface to cause the segments to separate from each other (dubbed \"Tap and Unwrap\" or \"Whack and Unwrap\").\n\nAnalysis:\nThe extracted content provides specific details about the structure of a Terry's Chocolate Orange, including the fact that it is divided into 20 segments and wrapped in orange-skin patterned foil. This information can help improve the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities by providing a clear understanding of the components of the chocolate orange and how they are connected. Understanding the structure of the chocolate orange can aid in logical inference about how it is manufactured and how it can be consumed, as well as in reasoning about the process of separating the segments from each other.
