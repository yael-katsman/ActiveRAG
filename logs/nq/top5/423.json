The passages also provide advanced information about specific breeds of cattle, such as the Tabapu\u00e3 breed in Brazil, and the different primal cuts of meat in various countries.\n\nThe associateal knowledge includes the fact that \"prime rib\" does not necessarily come from USDA Prime grade beef, and that primal cuts of meat differ between countries and cultures. For example, the naming and processing of cuts like \"rump steak\" and \"sirloin\" differ between British and American English, and fatback is used differently in Europe and North America.\n\nThe advanced information includes details about specific cattle breeds like the Tabapu\u00e3 breed in Brazil, which is of great economic importance in meat production and has the ability to adapt to different environmental conditions. Additionally, the passages mention specific meat cuts like Tafelspitz, which is known as the Standing Rump or Top Round in the United States, Topside in Britain, and Rump Cap in Australia.\n\nConsolidating this information, we can deepen our understanding of where prime rib comes from on a cow by recognizing the variations in naming and processing of meat cuts in different countries and cultures, as well as the significance of specific cattle breeds in meat production.

For example, in the United States, the term \"prime rib\" refers to a specific cut from the primal rib section, while in other countries, it may be known by different names or used differently in culinary traditions.\n\nAdditionally, the specific breed of cattle can also impact the quality and characteristics of the meat. For instance, the Tabapu\u00e3 breed in Brazil is known for its economic importance in meat production and its ability to adapt to different environmental conditions. Understanding the variations in naming, processing, and the influence of specific cattle breeds provides a broader context for where prime rib comes from on a cow.\n\nAnswer:\nPrime rib comes from the primal rib section of the cow, located between the shoulder and the loin.
