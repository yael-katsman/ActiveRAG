It is a small cylindrical fixture mounted above the sink, with the drain hose from the dishwasher feeding into the top of the air gap and the bottom of the air gap connected to the sink drain or garbage disposal unit. \n\nThe air gap creates an open vertical space between the dishwasher and the sink, ensuring that contaminated water cannot flow back into the dishwasher. This is achieved without any moving parts, making it a simple and reliable method of backflow prevention. Plumbing codes specify the minimum air gap distance required for different circumstances, such as a drain connection for a dishwasher.\n\nWithout an air gap, there is a risk of dirty water being siphoned into the water pipes through the faucet, potentially contaminating the drinking water system. The air gap prevents this by creating a physical barrier between the dishwasher and the sink, ensuring the safety of the water supply.\n\nIn addition, the concept of an air gap is also relevant in other contexts, such as in the operation of certain mechanical devices like scroll compressors, where air is pulled into the device to compress it.\n\nOverall, the air gap in a dishwasher plays a crucial role in maintaining the hygiene and safety of the water supply by preventing backflow contamination from the sink into the dishwasher.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\n        comprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
