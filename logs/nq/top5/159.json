The presence of dry ice storms on Mars, which are comparable to Earth's thunderstorms but involve crystalline CO2 instead of water in the clouds. This phenomenon suggests a dynamic and complex atmospheric system on Mars, which could play a role in the formation and distribution of snow or ice on the planet.\n\n2.
