The concept of federalism is particularly relevant as it is a proposed form of government in the country, and the model needs to understand how it differs from the current unitary state with a presidential system. Additionally, the existence of the Free Philippine Government and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region highlights the complexities of governance in the Philippines and the presence of autonomous regions within the country.

        "anchoring_output": "The form of government in the Philippines is a unitary presidential constitutional republic. This means that the country is governed by a system where the President is both the head of state and the head of government. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Additionally, it's important to note that there have been discussions about transitioning to a federal form of government, which would involve the creation of autonomous regions with their own local governments. This is particularly relevant in the context of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), which operates with a significant degree of autonomy from the national government. Therefore, while the current form of government is a unitary presidential constitutional republic, there are ongoing discussions and developments related to potential changes in the governance structure of the Philippines.",
