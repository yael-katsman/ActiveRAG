The concept of the Harmonic Convergence and its connection to the end of the Mayan Long Count in 2012, marking the end of history and the beginning of a new 5,125-year cycle. This concept involves the idea that the birth of the 6th Sun and the 5th Earth on December 21, 2012 would bring an end to the evils of the modern world.\n\n2. The different correlations proposed by Mayanist scholars for the start and end dates of the Mayan Long Count, such as the \"GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation\" and the \"Lounsbury/GMT+2\" correlation. These correlations have implications for the significance of specific dates, such as December 21, 2012, and December 23, 2012, in relation to the end of the Long Count.\n\n3. The Maya's use of the Long Count Calendar to measure time from a fixed start point, which they believed to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The concept of \"bak\u02bctun\"s and \"piktun\" cycles within the Maya calendar, as well as regional variations in managing exceptional cycles.\n\nAnalyzing the role of these contents:\nThese unfamiliar concepts provide background information on the Mayan Long Count, the significance of specific dates in Mayan eschatology, and the Maya's calendar system.
