It is mentioned that Switzerland is in the unusual position of being surrounded by countries that use the euro, and as a result, the euro is \"de facto\" accepted in many places, especially near borders and in tourist regions. The Swiss franc is one of the world's strongest currencies, worth around five-sixths of a euro. Additionally, Liechtenstein retains the ability to mint its own currency, the Liechtenstein franc, which it does from time to time for commemorative or emergency purposes.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the specific denominations of the coins used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, such as 5 centimes, 10 centimes, 20 centimes, \u00bd franc (50 centimes), 1 franc, 2 francs, and 5 francs. It is also mentioned that in the past, there were coins of 1 and 2 centimes.\n\nConsolidating this information, we can understand that Switzerland uses the Swiss franc as its official currency, and it is one of the world's strongest currencies. The euro is also widely accepted in Switzerland, especially in tourist regions and near borders. Additionally, Liechtenstein has the ability to mint its own currency.
