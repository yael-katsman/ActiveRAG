It flows southwest through East Tennessee into Chattanooga before crossing into Alabama, where it travels through the Huntsville and Decatur area before reaching the Muscle Shoals area. The river eventually forms a small part of the state's border with Mississippi before returning to Tennessee. It is the largest tributary of the Ohio River and drains the Tennessee Valley watershed, spanning across four states: Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky. The river's route in Tennessee defines the boundary between Middle and West Tennessee. This associateal knowledge provides a basic understanding of the Tennessee River's path and its significance in the region.\n\nAdditionally, the Tennessee River runs through Chattanooga, reaching as close as from the Georgia state line in Marion County.
