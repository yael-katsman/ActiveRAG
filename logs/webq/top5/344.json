The contemporary region of Flanders comprises a part of this historical county, as well as parts of the medieval duchy of Brabant and the medieval county of Loon. Prior to the 1600s, there were substantial waves of Flemish migration to the United Kingdom, with the first wave fleeing to England in the early 12th Century and largely resettled in Pembrokeshire.

Firstly, it provides historical context and background on the origins and migration patterns of the Flemish people, allowing the model to understand the reasons behind their migration and the impact it had on the regions they settled in.
