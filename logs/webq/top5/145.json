His experiments with pea plants led to the discovery of the principles of Mendelian genetics, which laid the associate for modern genetics. Mendel observed the inheritance of traits such as plant height, seed color, and flower color, and he discovered that each parent had a \"vote\" in the appearance of the offspring. He also demonstrated that traits are separately inherited and that dominant traits can mask the expression of recessive traits. Mendel's work was initially overlooked but was later rediscovered and recognized as groundbreaking in the field of genetics.\n\nAdditionally, Mendel's experiments involved cross-breeding different varieties of edible peas and recording the number of individuals in each generation that exhibited specific traits.
