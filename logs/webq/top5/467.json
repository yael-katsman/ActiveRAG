The concept of a \"bilingual country\" with two major languages in use, English and Jamaican Patois, and the existence of a dialect continuum between the two languages.\n\n2. The historical development of Jamaican Patois as a creole language, formed from a base of English words with elements of re-formed grammar, vocabulary from African languages, and Native American words.\n\n3. The process of decreolization that Jamaican Patois has undergone, similar to what happened with African American Vernacular English (AAVE), and the role of situational code-switching, style shifting, and code-alternation in communication between Jamaicans of all classes and in all situations.\n\n4. The historical context of Jamaica as a linguistically \"blank slate\" when the English took over the country from the Spanish in the seventeenth century, and the development of Jamaican Patois as a contact creole language unique to Jamaica due to the demand for field labor in the burgeoning sugar industry.\n\n5. The assimilation of Chinese Jamaicans through generations, resulting in the majority of them speaking English or Jamaican Patois as their first language, with anglicized given names and Chinese surnames.\n\nThese contents provide background knowledge about the linguistic diversity and historical development of languages in Jamaica, the social and historical factors influencing language use and development, and the impact of assimilation on language and culture.

The official language spoken in Jamaica is English, which is used in formal settings, education, and government. However, Jamaican Patois, also known as Jamaican Creole, is widely spoken as a local language or dialect in informal and everyday communication. Jamaican Patois has its roots in English but has evolved with influences from African languages, Native American words, and re-formed grammar. It is important to note that Jamaican Patois is not just a broken or simplified version of English but a distinct language with its own grammar and vocabulary.\n\nFurthermore, the use of Jamaican Patois is not limited to a specific social class or demographic.
