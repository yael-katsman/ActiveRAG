The mention of Solomon as the son of King Andrew I of Hungary and his wife, Anastasia of Kiev, and his birth in 1053. This historical information could provide context on the lineage of King Solomon and his family in a specific time period and geographical location.\n\n4. The mention of Theodore and Katherine as the parents of three children, including Eleanor Susan Brownell Anthony \"Toni\" Solomons, David Seixas Solomons, and Leon Henry Solomons.
