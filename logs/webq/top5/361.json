These titles and roles are important for understanding the form of government in North Korea, as they indicate a concentration of power in the hands of a single leader who holds multiple key positions in the government, military, and party. This concentration of power is characteristic of an authoritarian or totalitarian form of government, where a single leader or a small group holds absolute authority and control over the state and its institutions.
