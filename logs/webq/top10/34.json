The government exercised its executive powers in conformity with the Soviet constitution and legislation enacted by the Supreme Soviet. The system of government in the Soviet republics was based on a one-party communist system ruled by the Communist Party, with little real power being concentrated in official government bodies and organs. The first government was led by Vladimir Lenin, and the last government was led by Valentin Pavlov, with the appointment of Ivan Silayev being viewed as a breach of the Soviet constitution.\n\nThis information deepens our understanding of the question by providing insight into the leadership and structure of the Soviet government, the role of the Communist Party, and the complexities of the Soviet political system.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\n        comprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
