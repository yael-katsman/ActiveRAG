The fact that Puerto Rico does not have a local coin and uses the United States dollar as its local and only currency, which means it does not control its money supply or interest rates.\n3. The role of a representative from Puerto Rico in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who has served as a member of the board for the reserve bank several times.\n4.

        "anchoring_output": "The reasoning process is accurate, and the retrieved knowledge provides a comprehensive understanding of the currency system in Puerto Rico. \n\nEnhanced reasoning process:\nPuerto Rico's currency history is closely tied to its colonial past and its relationship with the United States. After the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898, Puerto Rico transitioned from using the Puerto Rican peso to adopting the United States dollar as its official currency. This decision was solidified by the passage of the Foraker Act in 1900, which established the U.S. dollar as the sole legal tender in Puerto Rico. As a result, Puerto Rico does not have its own distinct currency and instead uses the United States dollar for all transactions.\n\nAdditionally, Puerto Rico's monetary policy is directly influenced by the decisions of the Federal Reserve, as the island does not have control over its money supply or interest rates. This is further exemplified by the representation of Puerto Rico in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where a member from the island has served on the board of the reserve bank multiple times.\n\nAnswer:\nThe currency of Puerto Rico is the United States dollar.",

After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system were fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury. Puerto Rico does not have a local coin and uses the United States dollar as its local and only currency, which means it does not control its money supply or interest rates and is subject to the monetary policy of the United States, particularly to the operations performed by the Federal Reserve System. Additionally, the remaining exemplars of Puerto Rican currency have gathered significant value over the years, particularly in the United States, and are recognized as \"territorial\" currency by the United States Department of the Treasury.
