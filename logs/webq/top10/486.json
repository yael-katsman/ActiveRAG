The concept of federalism is also integral to the U.S. government system, emphasizing the sharing of powers between the national and state governments.\n\nThe U.S. state government operates based on the principles of democracy, with power vested in the people and exercised through elected representatives. The system of checks and balances, outlined in the constitution, ensures that no single branch of government becomes too powerful.
