They also mention the adoption of daylight saving time in Baja California due to its close ties to the U.S. state of California. Additionally, there is a reference to the \"California dial\" in watch-making, which consists of a clock face with a combination of Roman and Arabic numerals.\n\nFrom these passages, we can extract associateal knowledge about the history of timekeeping in California, including the lack of standardized timekeeping in the 19th century and the adoption of daylight saving time. The advanced information includes the specific details about the time offsets and changes in timekeeping practices in different regions, such as the decision to adopt daylight saving time in Baja California and the use of the \"California dial\" in watch-making.\n\nAnalyzing the role of these contents, we can see that they provide historical and cultural context related to timekeeping practices in California and its influence on neighboring regions. The information about the \"California dial\" also adds a cultural and technological aspect to the representation of California.\n\nIn summary, the passages deepen the understanding of the question by providing historical and cultural insights into timekeeping practices in California and the unique features associated with it, such as the \"California dial\" in watch-making.
