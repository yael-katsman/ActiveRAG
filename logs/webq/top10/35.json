Most Italians share a common culture, history, ancestry or language. Legally, all Italian nationals are citizens of the Italian Republic, regardless of ancestry or nation of residence (in effect, however, Italian nationality is largely based on jus sanguinis) and may be distinguished from people of Italian descent without Italian citizenship and from ethnic Italians living in territories adjacent to the Italian Peninsula without Italian citizenship. The majority of Italian nationals are speakers of Italian, or a regional variety thereof. However, many of them also speak another regional or minority language native to Italy; although there is disagreement on the total number, according to UNESCO there are approximately 30 languages native to Italy (often misleadingly referred to as \"Italian dialects\").\"\n\nThis passage provides important background knowledge about the Italian people, their common culture, history, and language. It also highlights the fact that while the majority of Italian nationals speak Italian, there are also regional or minority languages spoken in Italy. This information is crucial for understanding the linguistic diversity within Italy and the different languages spoken by Italians.
