I wanted to be like Jesus \u2013 'Heal the sick and raise the dead', instantly, without surgery, pills, et cetera.\" It was then, after two years into her degree, that she left and decided to find a job so she could acquire economic independence. Arzner, in spite of having abandoned the degree, had a broad education, which included architecture and art history courses.\"\n\n3. \"John Arnold was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He received the B.A. in psychology in 1934 from the University of Minnesota and a M.S. in mechanical engineering in 1940 from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
