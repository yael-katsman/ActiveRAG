This event marked the end of British colonial rule in the region, leading to the creation of the independent sovereign state of Pakistan. The independence movement was led by prominent leaders such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who played a crucial role in advocating for the rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and ultimately leading to the formation of Pakistan as a separate nation.
