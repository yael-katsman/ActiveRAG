The current government was established by the 1993 Constitution of Peru, which defines the country as democratic, social, independent, and sovereign. The government is composed of three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The President of Peru is both the head of state and government, and executive power is exercised by the President and the Government. Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the Congress, which is unicameral with 130 members elected for five-year terms. The judiciary is nominally independent, but political intervention into judicial matters has been common throughout history. Peru has a multi-party system, and coalition governments are formed due to the rarity of any single political organization obtaining an absolute majority in the Congress of Peru.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge about the government of Peru includes its unitary state structure, the role of the President as both head of state and government, and the three branches of government: executive, judicial, and legislative. The advanced information includes the specific details about the legislative branch being unicameral with 130 members elected for five-year terms, the rarity of any single political organization obtaining an absolute majority in the Congress, and the historical and modern-day political intervention into judicial matters.
