The role of this information is to provide a basic understanding of the time zones in Oklahoma.\n\nAdvanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the specific counties and communities in Oklahoma that observe Mountain Time, as well as the legal boundaries for the time zone. Additionally, the passages mention the unique situation of a highway in Kansas that crosses multiple time zones. This advanced information deepens the model's understanding of the complexity of time zones in the region.\n\nIn summary, the associateal knowledge provides a basic understanding of the time zones in Oklahoma, while the advanced information expands the model's knowledge by detailing specific locations and legal boundaries for different time zones within the state.
