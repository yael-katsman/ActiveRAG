The \u0111\u1ed3ng has been the currency of Vietnam since 1978 and is issued by the State Bank of Vietnam. It is represented by the symbol \"\u20ab\" and was traditionally subdivided into smaller units such as \"h\u00e0o\" and \"xu\", but these subdivisions are no longer widely used due to chronic inflation. \n\nThe passages also mention the historical use of Vietnamese cash coins, which were in circulation from the \u0110inh dynasty in 970 until the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty in 1945. These coins were made from various metals, including copper, lead, iron, and zinc, and were used alongside the \u0111\u1ed3ng. The government introduced coins made from an alloy of zinc, lead, and tin to discourage people from burying them, as the practice was causing coins to decompose faster.\n\nOverall, the information provides a historical and cultural context for the Vietnamese currency, which can deepen the model's understanding of Vietnam's economic and monetary background.
