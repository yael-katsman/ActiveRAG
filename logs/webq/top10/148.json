It is formed by the confluence of the Holston and French Broad rivers in Knoxville, Tennessee, and flows southwest through East Tennessee into Chattanooga before crossing into Alabama. From there, it travels through the Huntsville and Decatur area before reaching the Muscle Shoals area and eventually forming a small part of the state's border with Mississippi, before returning to Tennessee. The river's route northwesterly through Tennessee defines the boundary between Middle and West Tennessee.\n\nThe Tennessee River is located within four states: Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky. In East Tennessee, the river runs through Chattanooga and reaches as close as one mile from the tripoint where Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama meet. It also runs into Alabama south of Nickajack Dam.\n\nThis associateal knowledge provides a basic understanding of the Tennessee River's path and its significance as a major tributary of the Ohio River.
