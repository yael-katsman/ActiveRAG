One yuan is subdivided into 10 \"jiao\" and a \"jiao\" is subdivided into 10 \"fen\".\n- The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China and is the official currency of the People's Republic of China.\n- The communist forces introduced a new currency, denominated in yuan, which became the sole currency of mainland China at the end of the civil war. A new yuan was introduced in 1955 at a rate of 10,000 old yuan = 1 new yuan, known as the renminbi yuan.\n\nAnalysis:\nUnderstanding the associateal knowledge about the main language and currency of China is crucial for basic comprehension. The advanced information provides a deeper understanding of the historical and monetary aspects of China, including the transition from the cash to the yuan, the structure of the renminbi, and the historical context of currency changes in China.
