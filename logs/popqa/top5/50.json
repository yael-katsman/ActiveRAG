The genealogy of Muhammad Ibn Abi'l-Saj, tracing back to Shaiba ibn Hashim and Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the progenitor of the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraish tribe in Mecca. This information provides background on the family lineage and historical context of Muhammad Ibn Abi'l-Saj.\n\n2. The suspected father, Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam, who was a Jordanian national of Palestinian descent and had connections to extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS. This information sheds light on the potential identity and background of Muhammad Ibn Abi'l-Saj's father, and the potential implications of his father's affiliations.\n\n3. The mention of A\u1e25mad bin Isa, his son Abdullah, and grandson Basri, as well as other family members such as Sharif Mu\u1e25ammad bin Sulayman and Sharif A\u1e25mad al-Qudaymi, and their departure from Basra.
