It was originally the third largest tributary of the Liao River, but a river engineering project in 1958 made it a separate system draining into the Bohai Bay independently from the Liao River.\n- The Taiya River is a 17-mile-long river in Alaska, running from the border with British Columbia, Canada, to the Taiya Inlet of upper Lynn Canal.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge provides basic information about the location of Taia River in Romania and its connection to the Jiul de Est River. The advanced information deepens the understanding by introducing the Taizi River in China and the Taiya River in Alaska, expanding the model's knowledge boundaries beyond the familiar associateal knowledge.
