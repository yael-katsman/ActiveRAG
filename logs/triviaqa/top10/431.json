The model may have an overconfident response due to the lack of accurate information. The following information can be extracted to update the model's knowledge and prevent factual errors:\n\n1. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake occurred on April 18, 1906, and resulted in over 3,000 deaths and the destruction of about 28,000 buildings. This contradicts any existing knowledge that the earthquake did not cause significant damage or casualties.\n\n2. The earthquake also led to devastating fires that broke out in the city and lasted for several days, destroying over 80% of San Francisco. This information contradicts any belief that the earthquake did not have a significant impact on the city.\n\n3. The death toll from the earthquake and resulting fire is the greatest loss of life from a natural disaster in California's history. This contradicts any existing knowledge that the earthquake did not result in a significant loss of life.\n\nBy updating the model's knowledge with these accurate and verified details, the risk of model illusions and overconfident responses can be alleviated.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
