To enhance the understanding, it's important to note that the halogens are a group of nonmetal elements that share similar chemical properties. At room temperature, fluorine and chlorine exist as gases, while bromine is the only element from the halogens group that is liquid. This is due to its higher boiling point compared to fluorine and chlorine, which allows it to exist in a liquid state at room temperature.\n\nFurthermore, the advanced information about the properties of dinitrogen and hydrogen's classification as an alkali metal provides a deeper understanding of the chemical properties and behavior of these elements.
