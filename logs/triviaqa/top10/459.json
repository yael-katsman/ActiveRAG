It has evolved the unique ability to forage in the sea, making it a marine reptile. The iguana feeds almost exclusively on algae and can be seen in various habitats such as rocky shores, marshes, mangroves, and beaches. It is not fully adapted to marine life, as it nests on land and needs to bask in the sun to reach its ideal body temperature.\n\nThe Cuban iguana, on the other hand, is naturally distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and its surrounding islets, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast. It also has a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico, and a subspecies found on the Cayman Islands. The Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti as a defense measure.\n\nThe northern Bahamian rock iguana is found on the Andros and Exuma islands in the Bahamas, with a vulnerable status on the IUCN Red List and a wild population of less than 5,000 animals.\n\nThe information extracted from these passages can enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities by providing specific details about the distribution, habitat, and unique adaptations of different species of iguanas. This information can help the model understand the causal relationships between the habitat and behavior of these iguanas, as well as their evolutionary adaptations to their respective environments.

The marine iguana, known as Amblyrhynchus cristatus, is a species of iguana found exclusively on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in Ecuador. It has evolved unique adaptations to forage in the sea and feed on algae, making it a marine reptile. The iguana's habitat includes rocky shores, marshes, mangroves, and beaches, and it relies on basking in the sun to regulate its body temperature.\n\n2. In contrast, the Cuban iguana is naturally distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and its surrounding islets, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast.
