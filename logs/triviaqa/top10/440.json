        "anchoring_output": "The only US state to begin with the letter 'U' is Utah. This is because Utah is the only state in the United States that starts with the letter 'U'. The letter 'U' is the 21st letter in the ISO basic Latin alphabet and is used in various contexts, including state symbols, writing styles, and license plate designs. In the case of Utah, the letter 'U' holds cultural significance as it is featured in the hillside letters (mountain monograms) representing local universities. Additionally, understanding the historical origin and writing styles of the lowercase letter \"u\" provides context for its use in state names and symbols.\n\nAnswer:\nUtah",

The state is home to two of the oldest hillside letters, at Brigham Young University and the University of Utah. These symbols are deeply ingrained in the local culture, with the universities commonly referred to as \"The Y\" and \"The U.\" Additionally, the letter 'u' has a common origin with the letter 'v' and was originally written based on its location in a word rather than its sound. In terms of license plates, New Mexico is the only state that specifies \"USA\" to avoid confusion with the country Mexico. Furthermore, the era of the 1948 shield saw states modifying its design, with some omitting the letters \"U S\" and others moving them into the crown of the shield.
