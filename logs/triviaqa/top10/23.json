The Prince presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, where good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end - the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power.\n4. Machiavelli's work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, but he supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family.\n5.
