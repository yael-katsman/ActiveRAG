It is a well-known rock formation in the park, named for its distinct shape. One side is a sheer face while the other three sides are smooth and round, making it appear like a dome cut in half. The granite crest rises more than 4,737 feet above the valley floor. Hiking to the top of Half Dome is one of the most popular hikes from the valley, and the park now requires permits to use the trail. The Regular Northwest Face of Half Dome was the first Grade VI climb in the United States and is recognized as a classic climb around the world. In 2015, a major rockfall occurred on the Regular Northwest Face, altering pitches 10 and 11. The rockfall left clean slabs that can be climbed via bolt ladders and a pendulum with a tricky knot-toss rope maneuver. There is speculation that much more rock will exfoliate off other routes on Half Dome in the near future.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe selected information provides the model with a clear understanding of the location of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, California, and its significance as a popular rock formation and climbing destination. The details about the rockfall and the potential for future rock exfoliation enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities by illustrating the potential hazards and risks associated with climbing Half Dome. This information allows the model to make logical inferences about the safety considerations and challenges involved in rock climbing at Half Dome, thereby improving its ability to reason causally about the potential consequences of engaging in such activities.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to enhance the causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
