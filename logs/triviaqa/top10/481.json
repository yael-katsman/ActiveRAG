This information helps the model understand the causal relationship between ovulation, the movement of the egg, and its potential outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the passages also mention the role of hormonal signals in the process of ovulation, the preparation of the uterus to receive the ovum, and the shedding of the uterine lining and unfertilized ova through menstruation if fertilization does not occur.
