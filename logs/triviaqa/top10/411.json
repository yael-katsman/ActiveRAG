It is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses, with an associated product being rose water. The production technique originated in Persia and spread through Arabia, India, and eastern Europe. Damask roses (\"Rosa\" \u00d7 \"damascena\" \\'Trigintipetala\\') are commonly used in Bulgaria, Iran, and Germany, while \"Rosa\" \u00d7 \"centifolia\" is used in other parts of the world. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in color, and there are different extraction methods such as steam distillation for \"rose otto\" and solvent extraction for \"rose absolute.\" It takes a large amount of rose petals to distill a small amount of essential oil, and some dishonest dealers may dilute rose oil with other essential oils. Pure rose oil should not be used directly on the skin, as it can cause allergic reactions.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge extracted from the passages includes the basic process of obtaining rose oil from Damask roses through steam distillation, the use of rose water, and the different types of roses used for oil production. The advanced information includes the origins of the production technique, the different extraction methods for rose oil, the potential dilution of rose oil by dishonest dealers, and the precautions for using pure rose oil.
