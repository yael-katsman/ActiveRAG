He also isolated, synthesized, and named the principal psychedelic mushroom compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Additionally, Dr. Timothy Leary, a lecturer in psychology at Harvard University, was a prominent pro-LSD researcher who conducted experiments with psilocybin on himself and Harvard graduate students. He claimed that using LSD with the right dosage, set, and setting could alter behavior in beneficial ways.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the role of Alfred Matthew Hubbard as an early proponent for the drug LSD during the 1950s. Hubbard was known as the \"Johnny Appleseed of LSD\" and emphasized LSD's potential as a visionary or transcendental drug. Another advanced piece of information is the role of Dr. Ronald A. Sandison, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist who pioneered the clinical use of LSD in psychiatry.\n\nConsolidating this information, we can understand that Albert Hofmann was a key figure in the discovery and understanding of LSD and other psychedelic compounds. Dr. Timothy Leary, on the other hand, played a significant role in advocating for the use of LSD in psychological research and experimentation. Additionally, Alfred Matthew Hubbard and Dr. Ronald A. Sandison were also influential in promoting and pioneering the use of LSD for various purposes.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\n        comprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
