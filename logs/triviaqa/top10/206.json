To enhance the reasoning process, we can further explore the historical significance of the Isle of Mull Railway and its impact on tourism in the region. Additionally, we can delve into the reasons behind the closure of the railway and the subsequent plans for the estate and transportation in the area.\n\nEnhanced reasoning process:\n1. The Isle of Mull Railway, also known as the Torosay Castle Railway, operated a narrow gauge line from Craignure to Torosay Castle on the Isle of Mull in Scotland. The railway was a popular tourist attraction, providing scenic transportation for visitors to the castle and its gardens.\n\n2. Torosay Castle, located south of Craignure, is a historic estate with a grand house and extensive gardens. The idea of opening the castle and its gardens to the public was proposed, leading to plans for the construction of a narrow-gauge railway to facilitate visitor transportation from the ferry terminal to the estate.\n\n3. The closure of the Isle of Mull Railway was announced in 2010 due to uncertainty over the future of the estate. This decision raised concerns about the impact on tourism and transportation for visitors to Torosay Castle.\n\n4.
