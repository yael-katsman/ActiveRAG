        "anchoring_output": "Upon further consideration and incorporating the retrieved knowledge, it is evident that in certain religions, the notion of heaven is divided into parts to accommodate different levels of spiritual attainment or righteousness. For example, in Theosophy, the concept of \"Summerland\" represents the upper astral plane where various heavens are located, and souls are believed to be recalled back to Earth after a certain period by the \"Lords of Karma\" to incarnate again. Additionally, the idea of \"Devachan\" as the final heaven that souls go to after completing their cycle of incarnations further illustrates the division of heaven into different levels based on spiritual progression.\n\nFurthermore, the diverse conceptions of the omnipresence of a supreme being in monotheistic, pantheistic, and panentheistic beliefs also contribute to the division of heaven into parts in certain religions. These beliefs emphasize the varying degrees of bliss or closeness to the divine based on individual actions and beliefs in life, leading to the notion of different levels of spiritual attainment or righteousness within the concept of heaven.\n\nTherefore, where certain religions divide the notion of heaven into parts, there are generally different levels of spiritual attainment or righteousness that correspond to the diverse beliefs about the afterlife and the nature of the divine in those religious systems.",
