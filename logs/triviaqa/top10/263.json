The national seal and banknotes of the United States feature the phrase \"E pluribus unum\".\n\nAnswer:\nUnited States\n        To update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions. \n        I retrieved some knowledge that may update the language model's knowledge and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions\n        Note that these passages are retrieved from the most authoritative knowledge repositories, so they are assumed to be correct.\n        knowledge:\n        The passages provide information that 'E pluribus unum' is a traditional motto of the United States, appearing on the Great Seal and on U.S. coins and currency. This information contradicts the model's existing knowledge if it does not have the United States as the nation associated with the motto. Adding this information to the model's knowledge will update it and prevent factual errors, alleviating model illusions.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to update the language model's knowledge, prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
