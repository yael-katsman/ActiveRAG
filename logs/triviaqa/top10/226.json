The operation involved the use of military and Air America helicopters to transport evacuees to U.S. Navy ships off-shore during a 24-hour period preceding the fall of Saigon. The operation also involved the deliberate crash landing of some helicopters into the sea after dropping off their passengers, as well as the transfer of Vietnamese ships to the U.S. Seventh Fleet for evacuation.\n\n- Operation New Life and Operation New Arrivals: These were the operations through which more than 130,000 Vietnamese closely associated with the United States or the former government of South Vietnam were evacuated and resettled in the United States. These operations played a crucial role in the evacuation and resettlement of Vietnamese refugees following the fall of Saigon.\n\n- Operation Baby Lift: This operation involved the airlifting of Vietnamese orphans from Saigon during the fall of the city in April 1975. The operation faced challenges, including an aircraft being hit by rocket/mortar fire, which essentially ended the fixed wing air evacuation.\n\nThese contents provide important background information about the specific operations and challenges involved in the evacuation of U.S. citizens and Vietnamese nationals from Saigon during the final days of the Vietnam War.
