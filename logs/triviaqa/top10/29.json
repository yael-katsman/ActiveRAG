They act in various ways on the peripheral and central nervous systems, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and opioid drugs like hydrocodone, codeine, and oxycodone. Adjuvant analgesics, also known as atypical analgesics, include drugs with anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties. The term \"analgesic\" derives from the Greek words \"an-\" (without) and \"\u00e1lgos\" (pain), and these drugs were previously known as anodynes before the 20th century.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe selected information can impact the improvement of the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities by providing a comprehensive understanding of the different types of analgesic drugs, their mechanisms of action, and their historical context. This knowledge can help the model make logical inferences about the classification of analgesics, their effects on the nervous system, and their historical evolution. Additionally, the information about adjuvant analgesics can enhance the model's causal reasoning by allowing it to consider the modulation and modification of opioid action in pain management.
