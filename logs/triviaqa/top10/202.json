To enhance the understanding, it is important to note that the Blue Riband was a prestigious accolade in the era of transatlantic passenger ship travel, and it symbolized the fastest crossing in the westbound direction. The accolade was highly sought after by shipping companies, and achieving the Blue Riband status was a significant achievement. The SS United States' record-breaking maiden voyage in 1952 solidified its place in history as the holder of both the fastest eastbound and westbound transatlantic crossings, earning the coveted Blue Riband accolade.
