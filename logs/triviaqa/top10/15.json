The shootout resulted in the deaths of Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers, with Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday being wounded. Wyatt Earp, although often erroneously regarded as the central figure, was unharmed. The gunfight is a famous example of a real-life western shootout and is generally regarded as the most famous shootout in the history of the American Wild West. The gunfight itself did not actually happen in the corral, but in a vacant lot outside of it. The association between the gunfight and the O.K.
