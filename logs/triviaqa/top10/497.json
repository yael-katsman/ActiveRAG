The first phase lasts as long as any red balls remain on the table.\n\nAdvanced information:\n- The red ball is placed on the \"baulk\" at the beginning of the game, and the first player begins by playing in-hand from behind the baulk line.\n- American snooker often uses 54mm balls, but may use standard 52.5mm balls. It is typically played on a table, as full-size regulation British-style tables are rare in the United States.\n- A snooker table has six pockets, one at each corner and one at the center of each of the longest side cushions. The pockets are around 86mm, though high-class tournaments may use slightly smaller pockets to increase difficulty.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge provides the basic understanding of the number and types of balls present at the beginning of a snooker game. The advanced information delves into specific details such as the placement of the red ball, variations in table sizes and pocket sizes, and the use of different ball sizes in American snooker.
