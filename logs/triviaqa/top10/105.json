This drink eventually evolved into what is now known as Scotch whisky. The earliest record of distillation in Scotland occurred in 1494, as documented in the \"Exchequer Rolls\". The drink was generally flavored with juniper berries and was known as jenever in Dutch, which the English later modified to \"gin\". The process of distillation likely originated in India and was known to Islamic chemists as early as the eighth century. The Moorish Occupation of Spain also played a role in bringing distilling technology to the peninsula. Additionally, alcohol distillation rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the Black Death. These spirits would have had a much lower alcohol content than the alchemists' pure distillations and were likely first thought of as medicinal elixirs.
