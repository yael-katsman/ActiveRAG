The fire destroyed most of the city, which had been mostly abandoned by its residents the previous month.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the details of the 1812 Fire of Moscow, such as the fact that people fled into stone churches to escape the flames, but the churches collapsed, and many people drowned in the Moscow River. Additionally, the powder magazine of the Kremlin exploded, and those hiding in the cellar there asphyxiated. The tsar ordered the dead found on the streets to be thrown into the river, which overflowed its banks and flooded parts of the town.\n\nAnalyzing the role of these contents, the associateal knowledge provides the basic understanding of the event, while the advanced information deepens the model's understanding by providing specific details of the fire's impact on the city and its residents.
