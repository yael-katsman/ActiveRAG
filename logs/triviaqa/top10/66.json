The pommel is the end of the sword's hilt, which can be made of various materials such as wood, horn, bone, or even exotic materials like ivory or silver plating. It is also mentioned that the pommel is threaded at the end to fasten the foil assembly together in the case of an Italian grip. Additionally, the passages mention variations of pommels, such as the horse-hoof and cockatua pommels.\n\nThis associateal knowledge about the pommel provides a basic understanding of its role in a sword's construction. The advanced information includes the different materials and variations used in making pommels, as well as the specific function of the pommel in fastening the foil assembly together.\n\nIn summary, the pommel is a crucial part of a sword's hilt, and its design and material can vary widely.
