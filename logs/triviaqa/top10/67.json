It was traditionally held by and for the people who live in the local village of Brockworth, Gloucestershire, but now people from all over the world take part. \"The Guardian\" newspaper called it a \"world-famous event\", with winners from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Nepal.\n\n- A large round cheese is rolled down the steep slope of the hill and chased by a group of \"runners\", who in fact spend most of their brief descent to the bottom of the hill falling and tumbling. Two hundred years ago this was part of a larger mid-summer festival with other activities and competitions, but the event is now confined to the cheese-rolling and is held in May during the Spring Bank-holiday Monday. It is usually said to have originated as a pagan festival celebrating the arrival of summer, fertility, or both.\n\n- Due to the steepness and uneven surface of Cooper's Hill, there are usually a number of injuries each year. A first aid service is provided by the local St John Ambulance (Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Stroud Divisions) at the bottom of the hill. Members of the local rugby club and Young Farmers volunteer their services by acting as 'catchers' for any participants who lose their balance and also are on hand to carry down any casualties requiring first aid who do not reach the bottom. A number of ambulance vehicles attend the event, since there is invariably at least one and often several injuries requiring hospital treatment.\n\nThe model's existing knowledge may not include the specific details about the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake event, such as its origins as a pagan festival, the involvement of local organizations in providing first aid, and the frequency of injuries during the event.
