The dish is believed to have originated in Belgium, specifically in the Meuse valley between Dinant and Li\u00e8ge, around 1680. The people in this region used to prepare meals with small amounts of fried fish, but when fishing became impossible due to frozen rivers, they started cutting up potatoes and frying them in animal oil. The earliest evidence of fried potatoes in Belgium dates back to 1781, and it is argued that American soldiers during World War I called them \"french fries\" because the Belgian soldiers who introduced them spoke French.\n\nThe dispute between the French and Belgians about the invention of fries further emphasizes the Belgian standpoint, explaining the popularity of the term \"french fries\" as a result of French gastronomic hegemony into which the cuisine of Belgium was assimilated.\n\nThe information extracted from these passages can significantly enhance the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities by providing concrete historical and cultural context. By understanding the specific origin and historical background of French fries, the model can better grasp the cause-and-effect relationships related to the dish's creation, popularization, and naming.
