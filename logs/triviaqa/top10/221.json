The Nordic Passport Union, established in stages in 1952, which allowed for the abolishment of passports for travel between Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, as well as the readmission of citizens of other countries who had entered illegally into one of the four countries.\n\n2. The Schengen Agreement, which abolished border controls between member states of the EU, with opt-outs for Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\n3. The agreement signed in 1985 by Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany, on the gradual abolition of common border controls, which was signed on a river-boat near the town of Schengen, Luxembourg.\n\n4. The EU Regulation revising the Schengen Borders Code, which introduced systematic checks of travel documents of EU, EEA, and Swiss citizens against relevant databases when entering and leaving the Schengen Area.\n\n5. The specific rules and regulations regarding the Nordic Passport Union, including the application of the Schengen \"acquis\" to the area, the removal of border checkpoints, and the extra rights enjoyed by citizens within the Nordic area.\n\n6. The temporary re-imposition of limited controls at some internal borders in response to the migrant crisis, and the decision by the German Ministry of Interior to subject flights from Greece to advanced checks, retracting from the Schengen Area processing by invoking Article 25 of the Schengen Agreement.\n\n7. The competence to pass laws on crossing internal and external borders within the European Union and the associated Schengen Area states, with specific opt-outs for the United Kingdom and Ireland maintaining the Common Travel Area amongst themselves.\n\nThese contents provide background information on the different agreements and regulations related to passport controls and border abolishment within the EU and non-EU states.

This agreement, signed in 1985 near the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, initially included Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany. It aimed to gradually abolish common border controls and has since expanded to include 22 EU member states and 4 non-EU states. The Schengen Agreement allows for the free movement of people within the Schengen Area, with the removal of internal border checks. It also established common rules for controlling external borders.

This agreement abolished passports for travel between these countries and allowed citizens to reside and work in any of the member countries without a residence or work permit. Additionally, the Schengen Agreement abolished border controls between member states, with exceptions for Ireland and the United Kingdom. The Schengen \"acquis\" was incorporated into EU treaties, and the Nordic Passport Union area also became part of the Schengen Area. \n\nThe advanced information includes the signing of an agreement in 1985 by Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany for the gradual abolition of common border controls, which led to the Schengen Agreement. Furthermore, the EU Regulation revised the Schengen Borders Code in 2017, introducing systematic checks of travel documents for EU, EEA, and Swiss citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area.\n\nConsolidating this information, the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Agreement played crucial roles in abolishing passport controls and border checks within their member states. The gradual abolition of common border controls by certain member states in 1985 ultimately led to the Schengen Agreement, which has had a significant impact on passport controls and border checks within the EU and associated non-EU states. The incorporation of the Nordic Passport Union into the Schengen Area further expanded the scope of passport-free travel and residence within the region.
