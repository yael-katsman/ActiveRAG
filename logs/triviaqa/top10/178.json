The history of modern massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like \"EverQuest\" and \"Ultima Online\", and related virtual world genres such as the social virtual worlds exemplified by \"Second Life\", can be traced directly back to the MUD genre. Before the invention of the term MMORPG, games of this style were simply called graphical MUDs. A number of influential MMORPG designers began as and/or players (such as Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Matt Firor, and Brian Green) or were involved with early MUDs (like Mark Jacobs and J. Todd Coleman).\n\n2. MMORPG is a term coined by Richard Garriott to refer to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities. The link between Garriott and the MMORPG term has been recognized by many scholars. Previous to this and related coinages, these games were generally called graphical MUDs; the history of MMORPGs traces back directly through the MUD genre.\n\n3. The first fully graphical multi-user RPG was \"Neverwinter Nights\", which was delivered through America Online in 1991 and was personally championed by AOL President Steve Case. Other early proprietary graphical online RPGs include three on The Sierra Network: \"The Shadow of Yserbius\" in 1992, \"The Fates of Twinion\" in 1993, and \"The Ruins of Cawdor\" in 1995. Another milestone came in 1995 as NSFNET restrictions were lifted, opening the Internet up for game developers, which allowed for the first truly \"massively\"-scoped titles.\n\n4. In a recent study, Professor Griffiths co-wrote conducted a study with Helena Cole, a researcher in the Division of psychology Nottingham Trent University, that explored what the social interactions occur both within and outside of MMORPGs. The study showed that social interactions in MMORPGs are a major component in the enjoyment of playing video games. The study also showed MMORPGs can be extremely social games, with a vast number of gamers who play MMORPGs making lifelong friends or even partners.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",

It is a genre of online games that allows a large number of players to interact with one another in a virtual world. The term MMORPG was coined by Richard Garriott, and the history of MMORPGs can be traced back to the MUD (multi-user dungeon) genre. Influential MMORPG designers such as Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green, and J. Todd Coleman have played significant roles in the development of MMORPGs.\n\nThe development of MMORPGs requires significant investments of time and money, and running the game can be a long-term commitment. While many MMORPGs are produced by companies, there are also independent development teams working on MMORPGs. These independent MMORPGs represent a wide spectrum of genres, gameplay types, and revenue systems.\n\nStudies have shown that social interactions in MMORPGs are a major component of the enjoyment of playing these games. Players often make lifelong friends or even partners through MMORPGs, and gaming may allow them to express themselves in ways they might not be comfortable doing in real life.\n\nOverall, MMORPGs have a rich history rooted in the MUD genre, and influential designers have played pivotal roles in shaping the genre.
