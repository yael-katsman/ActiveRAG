The vision for the university was based on widening access to high standards of scholarship in higher education. Planning for the university began in 1965 under the Minister of State for Education, Jennie Lee. The first students enrolled in January 1971, and the university administration is based at Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire. The Open University was the world's first successful distance teaching university and used television to broadcast teaching programs. The university awards undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as non-degree qualifications such as diplomas and certificates or continuing education units.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the role of key individuals such as Michael Young, Jennie Lee, and Sir Peter Venables in the establishment of the Open University. Additionally, the model can deepen its understanding by learning about the university's recognition as an institute of higher learning in Israel and its role in hosting the first online \"virtual\" graduation ceremony in the United Kingdom in 2000.
