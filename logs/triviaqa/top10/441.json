It was constructed between 1859 and 1869 and officially opened on 17 November 1869. The canal offers a more direct route for watercraft between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans, thus reducing the journey distance. It allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa. The Red Sea's level is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. The Suez Canal Authority is responsible for its operation.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe selected information provides a comprehensive understanding of the Suez Canal, its construction, and its impact on the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. It also explains the ecological impact of the canal on the migration of species between the two seas. By understanding these details, the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities can be improved as it gains insights into the historical, geographical, and ecological factors related to the Suez Canal.
