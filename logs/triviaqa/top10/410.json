This decision was made through a competitive bidding process, where Rio de Janeiro emerged as the winning city, making it the first city in South America to host the Olympic Games. The selection of Rio de Janeiro was significant, considering the cultural and geographical impact of hosting the games in South America. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) played a crucial role in the selection process, following the rules and regulations outlined in the Olympic Charter.
