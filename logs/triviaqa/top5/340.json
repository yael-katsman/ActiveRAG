        "anchoring_output": "The reasoning process is accurate and provides a good understanding of the concept. To enhance the reasoning process, we can further explain the role of fontanelles in the development of the skull and their significance during birth.\n\nFontanelles are soft spots on a baby's head that are formed by the intersection of the skull's bony plates, which are connected by fibrous tissue. These soft spots allow for the flexibility of the skull during birth, as the bony plates can overlap and shift to accommodate the passage of the baby's head through the birth canal. This flexibility is crucial for a successful and safe delivery.\n\nAdditionally, fontanelles also play a role in the growth and development of the infant's brain and skull after birth. They allow for the expansion of the skull as the brain grows, and eventually, the fontanelles close as the bony plates of the skull fuse together, typically by the age of 2.\n\nAnswer:\nThe soft spots on a baby's head, which enable the bony plates of the skull to flex during birth, are called fontanelles.",
