This information can help the model understand the context of vehicle registration in Cambodia and the aviation industry in the country. However, the mention of vehicle registration plates of Cameroon and the international vehicle registration code for Thailand is not directly relevant to the question and may not contribute significantly to the model's understanding of Cambodia's international vehicle registration.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
        "anchoring_output": "Enhanced reasoning process:\nTo better understand the international vehicle registration for Cambodia, it's important to note that the format and process for vehicle registration in Cambodia may differ from other countries. In Cambodia, the international vehicle registration consists of the country code \"KHM\" followed by a hyphen and a unique combination of letters and numbers specific to the vehicle. This registration is typically displayed on a small white oval sticker with black letters and numbers.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to clarify that the international vehicle registration is used for vehicles that are registered in Cambodia and intended for international travel. This registration helps identify Cambodian vehicles when traveling across borders and is a requirement for international road trips.\n\nAnswer:\nThe International Vehicle Registration for Cambodia is \"KHM-XXXX\".",

The advanced information about Cambodia Airways obtaining the AOC certificate and commencing commercial flight routes is unrelated to the question about international vehicle registration for Cambodia.\n\nConsolidated summary:\nIn Cambodia, vehicle license plates are required by law and display the province where the vehicle is registered. The owner must register the car in the province where they live, and if the car is transferred to someone in a different province, the number usually changes.
