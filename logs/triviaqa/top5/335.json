The Ecto-1, a modified 1959 Cadillac ambulance, was used as the pursuit/transportation vehicle by the Ghostbusters. The vehicle was named on-screen with the license plate shown reading \"Ecto-1\". The filmmakers planned to have the Ecto-1 painted black, but the color of the vehicle was changed to white when it was decided a black car would be too difficult to see during night scenes. Three cars have played the vehicle in the movies, and the black Miller-Meteor seen at the beginning of the first movie was leased and used only for that scene and never converted for filming, though it was later purchased by the studio and completely converted to a full Ecto-1 for touring. Both of the other Ectomobiles are currently sitting in a Sony pictures backlot, having undergone a full restoration after years of deterioration.\n\nAnalyzing this information can help improve the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities by providing it with specific details about the Ecto-1 and its history. This information can help the model understand the context and background of the Ecto-1, its significance to the Ghostbusters, and the decision-making process behind its design and use in the movies.
