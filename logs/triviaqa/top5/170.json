It is also part of the Kalahari Basin or Kalahari Depression, which covers over 2.5 million km and includes most of Botswana and parts of Namibia, South Africa, Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The Kalahari Desert is not strictly a desert in the traditional sense due to its dense ground cover, except in the southwest region. The land in the Kalahari Desert is predominantly flat to gently undulating tableland, with some hilly country where mining is carried out. The desert is located in the central and southwest regions, while the northwest contains the Okavango Delta and the north-central area includes the Makgadikgadi Pans, a large salt pan. This area has been established as an early habitation area for primitive man and is composed of several large component pans.

The Kalahari Basin or Kalahari Depression is a large lowland area covering over 2.5 million km, covering most of Botswana and parts of Namibia, South Africa, Angola, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The outstanding physical feature in the basin, and occupying the center, is the large Kalahari Desert. The city Windhoek is situated in the Kalahari Basin. The land is predominantly flat to gently undulating tableland, although there is some hilly country, where mining is carried out. The Kalahari Desert is in the central and the southwest. The Okavango Delta, one of the world's largest inland deltas, is in the northwest and the Makgadikgadi Pans, a large salt pan lies in the north-central area.\n\nAnalyzing this information can help improve the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities by providing a clear understanding of the geographical location and extent of the Kalahari Desert. It also highlights the relationship between the Kalahari Basin and the Kalahari Desert, as well as the presence of other geographical features such as the Okavango Delta and the Makgadikgadi Pans.
