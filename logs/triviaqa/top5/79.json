Shinto was instated as the official state religion, leading to government confiscation of Buddhist lands and a decrease in financial support for Buddhist temples. The government also abolished celibacy and vegetarianism for Buddhist monastics in an effort to secularize them and promote State Shinto. The Meiji Restoration also involved the centralization of imperial power and the modernization of the state, leading to the enactment of an order to eliminate the mutual influence of Shinto and Buddhism and a movement to eradicate Buddhism. However, after World War II, the current constitution was drafted, and the Emperor, Buddhism, and Shintoism were officially separated, with Shintoism no longer being the state religion.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge from these passages includes the historical context of the Meiji Restoration, the instatement of Shinto as the state religion, and the government's efforts to promote State Shinto while suppressing Buddhism.
