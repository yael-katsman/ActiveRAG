The people in the Meuse valley region used to prepare meals with small amounts of fried fish, but when the river froze over and fishing became impossible, they started cutting up potatoes and frying them in animal oil as a substitute. French fries were introduced as a snack in American caf\u00e9s during the early 19th century, but they did not become popular until large fast food companies such as McDonald's and Burger King incorporated them into their menus during the mid-20th century.
