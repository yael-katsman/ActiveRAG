It was then used only for goods trains until 1981. The site is now occupied by a housing estate. Additionally, the passages mention the wreck of a steamship called the Fitzroy in 1921, as well as the establishment of the township of Fitzroy Harbour in 1823, which was an important center of the timber trade in the 19th century.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge is that the Fitzroy sea area was formerly known as Finisterre in the UK Shipping Forecast until 2002, when it was renamed FitzRoy in honor of the founder of the Met Office. This change was made to avoid confusion with a smaller sea area of the same name in the marine forecasts produced by the French and Spanish meteorological offices.\n\nBy consolidating this information, the model can deepen its understanding of the question by learning about the historical significance of Fitzroy as a railway station and township, as well as the renaming of the Fitzroy sea area in the UK Shipping Forecast. This expanded knowledge will enable the model to provide a more comprehensive and accurate response to the question about the former name of the shipping area Fitzroy until 2002.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to deepen the understanding of the question through familiarity with basic and advanced pieces of information,\n        comprehend the question more thoroughly, and expand the knowledge boundaries.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
