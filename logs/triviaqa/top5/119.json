Frugivores play a significant role in the ecosystem by either benefiting fruit-producing plants through seed dispersal or hindering plants by digesting seeds along with the fruits. The interaction between fruit-producing plants and frugivore species, when both benefit from fruit-eating behavior, is called mutualism.

They can be herbivores or omnivores, with fruit being their preferred food type. Approximately 20% of all mammalian herbivores also eat fruit, making frugivory common among mammals. Frugivores play a crucial role in the ecosystem by dispersing seeds of fruit-producing plants, which can benefit both the plants and the frugivore species in a mutualistic interaction.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge about frugivores includes their diet of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, and their role as herbivores or omnivores.

It also explains the impact of frugivores on fruit-producing plants, either by dispersing seeds or hindering plant growth. By understanding these causal relationships, the model's logical inference abilities can be improved as it learns the consequences of frugivore behavior on the ecosystem and the mutualistic interactions between frugivores and fruit-producing plants.
