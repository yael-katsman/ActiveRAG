The border along the territorial waters with Sweden runs along the \u00d8resund for a length of about 115 km.\n\nAdvanced information: The Danish-German border area has changed several times through history, and the present border was determined by referendums in 1920. Both countries are full members of NATO and the European Union, and the border region is seen as a positive example for other border regions due to substantial minority populations living on both sides and frequent cross-border cooperation activities.\n\nAnalysis: The associateal knowledge confirms that Denmark's only land border is with Germany, while the advanced information provides historical and geopolitical context to the relationship between Denmark and Germany.
