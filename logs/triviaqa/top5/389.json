Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories were convinced immediately after its discovery in 1943 of the power and promise of LSD. For two decades following its discovery LSD was marketed by Sandoz as an important drug for psychological and neurological research. Hofmann saw the drug's potential for poets and artists as well, and took great interest in the German writer Ernst J\u00fcnger's psychedelic experiments.\n\n2. Alfred Matthew Hubbard (July 24, 1901\u2013August 31, 1982) was an early proponent for the drug LSD during the 1950s. He is reputed to have been the \"Johnny Appleseed of LSD\" and the first person to emphasize LSD's potential as a visionary or transcendental drug.\n\n3. In the late 1960s, Dr Ronald A. Sandison, a psychiatrist and psychotherapist who pioneered the clinical use of LSD in psychiatry, worked at Knowle Hospital.\n\nAnalysis:\nThese contents provide background information on key figures who were involved in the early research and promotion of LSD. Albert Hofmann and his colleagues recognized the potential of LSD for psychological and neurological research, as well as its potential for poets and artists. Alfred Matthew Hubbard was an early advocate for LSD and emphasized its potential as a visionary or transcendental drug. Dr. Ronald A. Sandison pioneered the clinical use of LSD in psychiatry. Understanding the roles and contributions of these individuals can provide context for the broader research and experimentation with LSD, including at Harvard University.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",

Specifically, the passages mention researchers such as Albert Hofmann and his colleagues at Sandoz Laboratories, Dr. Timothy Leary at Harvard University, Alfred Matthew Hubbard, and Dr. Ronald A. Sandison. These researchers were involved in experimenting with LSD and studying its effects on behavior and psychology.\n\nAnalyzing this information can impact the improvement of the model's causal reasoning and logical inference capabilities by providing real-world examples of how researchers have used LSD to study its effects on behavior and psychology. This can help the model understand the potential impact of substances like LSD on human behavior and cognition, and how researchers have approached studying and experimenting with such substances. Additionally, the information can also help the model understand the historical context and significance of LSD research, and how it has contributed to the field of psychology and neuroscience.

Leary claimed that using LSD with the right dosage, set (ones emotional mindset at time of ingestion), and setting, preferably with the guidance of professionals, could alter behavior in dramatic and beneficial ways. Dr. Leary began conducting experiments with psilocybin in 1960 on himself and a number of Harvard graduate students after trying hallucinogenic mushrooms used in Native American religious rituals while visiting Mexico. His group began conducting experiments on state prisoners, where they claimed a 90% success rate preventing repeat offenses.\n\nThis information contradicts the model's existing knowledge and could update the model's knowledge about the prominent researcher experimenting with LSD at Harvard University.
