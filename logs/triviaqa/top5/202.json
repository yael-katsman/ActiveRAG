This accolade was formalized with the creation of a trophy by Harold K. Hales in 1935, and it was awarded to the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic in the westbound direction. The rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the Blue Riband, and it was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders: \"Rex\" in 1935, \"Normandie\" in 1936, and \"United States\" in 1952.
