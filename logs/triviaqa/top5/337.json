However, it's important to note that there have been developments in effective communication theories in more recent times.\n\nPeter Senge, in the early 1990s, developed new theories on organizational communication, specifically the learning organization and systems thinking. These theories have gained widespread acceptance and are considered fundamental in current beliefs toward organizational communications.\n\nAdditionally, sociologist John Brookshire Thompson, a professor at the University of Cambridge, developed a conceptual framework for the analysis of mediated interaction in his book \"The Rise of Mediated Interaction,\" published in 1995.
