The Suez Canal is a sea-level waterway in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea through the Isthmus of Suez. It was constructed between 1859 and 1869 and officially opened on 17 November 1869. The canal offers watercraft a more direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas, thus avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and thereby reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London.\n\n2. The Suez Canal is considered the most important center of maritime transport in the Middle East, allowing ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa.\n\n3. The completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 linked the Levantine Sea to the Red Sea. The Red Sea's level is higher than the Eastern Mediterranean, so the canal serves as a tidal strait that pours Red Sea water into the Mediterranean. The Bitter Lakes, which are hypersaline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalized with that of the Red Sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonize the eastern Mediterranean. This migration of species is known as the Lessepsian migration, after Ferdinand de Lesseps, the chief engineer of the canal.\n\n4. The Suez Canal is a major waterway for international commerce and navigation, linking the Mediterranean and Red Sea. It is run by the Suez Canal Authority, headquartered in Port Said. The ministry of transportation, along with other governmental bodies, is responsible for transportation in Egypt. Major ports are Alexandria, Port Said, and Damietta on the Mediterranean, and Suez, Ain Sokhna, and Safaga on the Red Sea.\n\nAnalyzing the role of these contents:\n- These contents provide background information about the construction, significance, and impact of the Suez Canal, including its role in international commerce and maritime transport.\n- The information about the Lessepsian migration and the impact of the canal on the migration of species provides a scientific and ecological perspective, highlighting the environmental impact of the canal.\n- The details about the Suez Canal Authority and the ministry of transportation offer insights into the governance and management of the canal, as well as the broader transportation infrastructure in Egypt.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
