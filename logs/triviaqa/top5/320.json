The term \"ambidextrous\" comes from the Latin words \"ambi\" meaning \"both\" and \"dexter\" meaning \"right.\"\n3. An ambidextrous person can perform tasks with equal skill using either hand.\n\nAnswer:\nAmbidextrousTo provide the language model with relevant background and anchoring knowledge and concepts, helping it better understand the question.\n        I retrieved some knowledge that is may unfamiliar with the model: \n        knowledge:\n        The content that may be unfamiliar to the model includes the concept of ambidexterity, which is the ability to use both hands equally well. This concept is rare and can be learned, but even those who have learned it still tend to favor one hand over the other. The passages also mention cross-dominance, which is the use of different hands for different activities, and the universal constraints in sign languages related to hand articulation and dominance.\n\nThese concepts are important for the model to understand because they provide background knowledge about the rare ability of ambidexterity and the variations in hand dominance and usage. Understanding these concepts will help the model analyze and answer the question about the word applied to someone who is equally capable with both hands.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to help it better understand the question,\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",

Ambidexterity is the ability to use both hands equally well for various tasks, such as writing, drawing, and throwing.\n2. Cross-dominance is another term related to hand usage, where a person may use their left hand for some activities and their right hand for others.\n3. Sign languages also have constraints related to hand articulation and dominance, which can vary based on the individual's hand preference.\n\nAnswer:\nThe word applied to someone who is equally capable with both hands is \"ambidextrous.\" This term describes individuals who can perform tasks with equal skill using either hand, demonstrating a rare and valuable ability to be proficient with both hands.",

While some individuals can write competently with both hands, they usually still show a preference for one side.
