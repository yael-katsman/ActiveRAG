The kilt was worn throughout the Highlands by 1745.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the specific details of Rawlinson's partnership with Ian MacDonnell, the chief of the MacDonnells of Glengarry, and their involvement in manufacturing charcoal and smelting iron ore in the Highlands.
