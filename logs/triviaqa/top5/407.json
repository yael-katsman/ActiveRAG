British General John Burgoyne led a large invasion army southward from Canada, hoping to meet other British forces, but he was surrounded by American forces in upstate New York. The final surrender took place in Saratoga, often cited as the turning point for the United States during the war.\n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes the Yorktown Wrecks, an area in Virginia's York River where significant naval remnants of the American Revolutionary War are located. In the days preceding the Siege of Yorktown, American and French naval forces sank a number of British vessels, and General Charles Cornwallis ordered the scuttling of other ships. At the end of the siege and the British surrender, at least twenty-six British vessels were unaccounted for and are believed to lie in the York River.\n\nConsolidating this information, the Battles of Saratoga and the Siege of Yorktown were both significant events in the American Revolutionary War, ultimately leading to decisive victories for the American forces over the British. The surrender at Saratoga is often considered a turning point in the war, while the naval remnants in the York River provide further evidence of the events that led to the British surrender at Yorktown.
