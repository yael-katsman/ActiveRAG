It originates in eastern Turkey and is one of the defining rivers of Mesopotamia. The Euphrates and the Tigris are irregular rivers, causing problems with droughts in summer and flooding in winter. The water of the Euphrates River is regulated by large reservoirs and dams. The length of the Euphrates from its source to the confluence with the Tigris is approximately 2,800 kilometers.\n\nThe associateal knowledge includes the basic geographical and historical significance of the Euphrates River, while the advanced information provides details about its regulation and length.
