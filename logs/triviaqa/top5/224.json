The city is surrounded by mountains on three sides, including the Saguramo Range to the north and various sub-ranges of the Trialeti Range to the south and west. The complex relief of the city, with the Trialeti Range creating a significant barrier to urban development on the right bank of the river, has led to densely developed areas and undeveloped pockets within the city.\n\nThe name \"Tbilisi\" derives from the Old Georgian word \"Tpili\", meaning warm, due to the area's numerous sulfuric hot springs, which are still heavily exploited for public baths in the Abanotubani district. The city was founded by King Vakhtang I of Iberia, giving it control of trade routes between western and eastern Transcaucasia.\n\nThe Tbilisi funicular, a ropeway railway first built in 1905, connects Chonkadze street and Mtatsminda Park, covering almost 300 m in altitude difference. The top of the hill offers different views of Tbilisi and is home to the Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower and amusement rides.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge about Tbilisi's location and surrounding mountain ranges provides a basic understanding of the city's geographical setting. The advanced information about the city's founding by King Vakhtang I and its control of trade routes deepens the model's understanding of Tbilisi's historical and strategic significance.
