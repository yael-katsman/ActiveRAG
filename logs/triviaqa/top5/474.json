Sullivan began teaching Keller to communicate by spelling words into her hand, and she tailored her teaching methods to suit Keller's individual interests and needs. This adaptive approach ultimately led to Keller learning 575 words, multiplication tables, and the Braille system within six months. Additionally, Sullivan's influence extended beyond teaching Keller, as she also advocated for Keller's education at the Perkins School and remained a close companion to Keller throughout her education, even assisting her in obtaining a degree from Radcliffe College.\n\nBy consolidating this information, the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities can be enhanced by understanding the adaptive teaching methods employed by Anne Sullivan to effectively communicate with Helen Keller. This demonstrates the importance of tailoring teaching approaches to individual needs and interests, as well as the impact of a supportive and dedicated teacher-student relationship on the learning process. Additionally, the model can learn about the significant role of advocacy and support in ensuring access to education for individuals with disabilities, as exemplified by Sullivan's efforts to secure Keller's education at the Perkins School.
