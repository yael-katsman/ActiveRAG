They act on the peripheral and central nervous systems and include drugs such as paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and opioid drugs like hydrocodone, codeine, and oxycodone. Additionally, analgesics may include aspirin, phenacetin, and other medications used in the treatment of pain. Analeptics, on the other hand, are central nervous system stimulants used to treat conditions such as depression, ADHD, and respiratory depression.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe associateal knowledge extracted from the passages includes the definition of analgesic drugs as painkillers used to relieve pain by acting on the nervous systems. The advanced information beyond the model's familiar associateal knowledge includes specific examples of analgesic drugs such as paracetamol, NSAIDs, and opioid drugs, as well as the mention of analeptics as central nervous system stimulants used for various medical conditions.
