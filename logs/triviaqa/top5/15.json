Corral took place in Tombstone, Arizona Territory on October 26, 1881. It was a 30-second shootout between lawmen and members of a group of outlaws called the Cowboys. The shootout resulted in the deaths of Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers, and the wounding of Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday. Wyatt Earp, although often erroneously regarded as the central figure, was unharmed. The gunfight did not actually happen in the corral, but in a vacant lot outside of it. The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols, and both parties simultaneously drew their guns. It is not known who fired the first shot, but Wyatt's bullet was the first to hit. Doc Holliday instantly killed Tom with blasts from his shotgun, and then shot Frank in the right temple. Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him, striking Virgil's leg, and Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe selected information provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and during the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. By understanding the sequence of actions and the consequences of each party's decisions, the model's causal reasoning and logical inference abilities can be enhanced. The model can learn to analyze the cause-and-effect relationships between the actions of the lawmen and the outlaws, as well as the outcomes of their decisions during the shootout. Additionally, the information about the location of the gunfight and the specific actions of each individual involved can help the model develop a deeper understanding of how different factors contributed to the overall outcome of the event. This can ultimately improve the model's ability to make logical inferences based on causal relationships in historical contexts.\n        Please verify the above reasoning process for errors, \n        then enhance this reasoning process using retrieved knowledge to enhance the causal reasoning and logical inference abilities.\n        Afterward, give the answer based on the enhanced reasoning process.\n        \n        Generation Format:\n        knowledge enhanced inference process:\n        Answer:\n                    ",
