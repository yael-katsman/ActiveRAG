Albatross in golf denotes three strokes less than par.\n2. An albatross, also called a double eagle, is a score of three-under-par on a single hole.\n3. This is most commonly achieved with two shots on a par-5, but can be done with a hole-in-one on a par-4.\n4. Shooting three under par on a single hole has recently been termed scoring an \"albatross\", as a continuation on the birdie and eagle theme.\n\nAnalysis of the role of the extracted content:\nThe extracted content provides the model with the specific definition and context of an albatross in the game of golf. It explains that an albatross is a score of three-under-par on a single hole, and it can be achieved with either two shots on a par-5 or a hole-in-one on a par-4.
