The Book of Daniel is usually placed among the \"Writings\" in Hebrew Bibles but is instead placed at the end of the \"Prophets\". Additionally, the Old Testament sequence set out by Jerome in the Prologus galeatus identifies the books into four categories: The Law, the Prophets, the Writings, and the apocryphal books. \n\nThe advanced information beyond the model's associateal knowledge includes the different orders of the Old Testament books as set out by Jerome and Augustine. Jerome's order corresponds to the rabbinic ordering of the Hebrew Bible, while Augustine allocates the Old Testament into five categories: The Law, History, Narratives, the books of David and Solomon, and the Prophets. These different orders were adopted in various manuscripts and bibles, showing the diversity in the arrangement of the Old Testament books.\n\nConsolidating this information, it is important to understand the traditional Hebrew order of the Old Testament and the different categorizations of the books by Jerome and Augustine.
