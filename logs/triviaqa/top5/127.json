The Anabasis of Alexander was composed by Arrian of Nicomedia in the second century AD, most probably during the reign of Hadrian. It is a history of the campaigns of Alexander the Great, specifically his conquest of the Persian Empire between 336 and 323 BC. The title \"Anabasis\" and the work's seven-book structure reflect Arrian's emulation of the Greek historian Xenophon, whose own \"Anabasis\" in seven books concerned the earlier campaign \"up-country\" of Cyrus the Younger in 401 BC.\n\n2. Xenophon, a Greek writer from 431\u2013360 B.C., wrote Anabasis about the \"Army of the Ten Thousand\" \u2013 Greek mercenaries taking part in the expedition of Cyrus the Younger, a Persian prince, against his brother, King Artaxerxes II.\n\nThese contents provide background information about the Anabasis, its authors, and the historical context in which it was written.
