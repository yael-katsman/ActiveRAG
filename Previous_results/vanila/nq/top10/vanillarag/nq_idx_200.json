{"question": "what does it mean to fuse the spine", "vanilla_rag_result": "Fusing the spine refers to a surgical procedure aimed at joining two or more vertebrae together to eliminate movement between them. This is typically done to alleviate pain, stabilize the spine, or correct deformities. The process involves using bone grafts, metal rods, screws, or other devices to hold the vertebrae in place while they heal and grow together. The goal of spinal fusion is to provide stability and support to the spine, which can help improve function and reduce discomfort for individuals suffering from various spinal conditions."}
