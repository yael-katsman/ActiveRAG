{"question": "when did the study of media effects begin", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages you provided all relate to the same topic: the beginning of the study of media effects. However, since the specific content of the passages is not included, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the passages themselves. \n\nGenerally, the study of media effects began in the early 20th century, particularly with the rise of mass media such as radio and film. Key studies, such as the Payne Fund Studies in the 1930s, explored the impact of media on audiences, particularly children. If you have specific details or excerpts from the passages, I would be happy to help analyze them further!"}
