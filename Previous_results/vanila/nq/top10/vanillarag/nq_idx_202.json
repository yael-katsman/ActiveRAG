{"question": "is jaffa cakes a biscuit or a cake", "vanilla_rag_result": "Jaffa Cakes are often the subject of debate regarding whether they are classified as a biscuit or a cake. The distinction can depend on various factors, including their texture, ingredients, and legal definitions. \n\nIn the UK, a notable case in 1991 determined that Jaffa Cakes are classified as cakes for tax purposes, specifically because they are soft and spongy like cakes, and they harden when they go stale, which is characteristic of cakes rather than biscuits. \n\nHowever, in everyday usage, many people treat them like biscuits, as they are often eaten as a snack and are found in the biscuit aisle of stores. \n\nIn summary, while Jaffa Cakes are legally classified as cakes, they are commonly consumed and perceived as biscuits."}
