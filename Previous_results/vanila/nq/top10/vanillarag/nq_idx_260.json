{"question": "what are the four requirements to establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter", "vanilla_rag_result": "To establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter, the following four requirements must typically be met:\n\n1. **Duty of Care**: The defendant must owe a duty of care to the victim. This means that there is a legal obligation to act in a way that does not cause harm to others.\n\n2. **Breach of Duty**: The defendant must have breached that duty of care. This involves demonstrating that the defendant's actions fell significantly below the standard of care expected, indicating a lack of reasonable care.\n\n3. **Causation**: There must be a direct link between the breach of duty and the harm caused to the victim. The defendant's negligence must be a substantial factor in bringing about the victim's death.\n\n4. **Gross Negligence**: The negligence must be considered gross, meaning it is so severe that it demonstrates a complete disregard for the safety of others. This is typically assessed by considering whether the defendant's conduct was a serious departure from the standard of care expected.\n\nThese elements collectively establish the framework for determining liability in cases of gross negligence manslaughter."}
