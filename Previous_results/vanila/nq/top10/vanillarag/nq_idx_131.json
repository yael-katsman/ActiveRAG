{"question": "where does a roadrunner live in the desert", "vanilla_rag_result": "A roadrunner typically lives in arid and semi-arid regions of the desert. They are commonly found in areas with sparse vegetation, such as scrublands, open grasslands, and desert habitats. Roadrunners prefer environments that provide ample opportunities for foraging, such as areas with insects, small mammals, and other food sources. They are often seen running along the ground rather than flying, which is characteristic of their behavior in these desert landscapes."}
