{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "vanilla_rag_result": "The air gap on a dishwasher serves as a crucial component in preventing backflow of dirty water into the dishwasher from the sink. It creates a physical barrier that ensures wastewater cannot siphon back into the dishwasher, thereby maintaining the cleanliness and hygiene of the water used for washing dishes. The air gap allows for proper drainage and helps to protect the dishwasher's internal systems from contamination."}
