{"question": "where is simple squamous epithelium found in the body", "vanilla_rag_result": "Simple squamous epithelium is found in various locations throughout the body, including:\n\n1. **Alveoli of the lungs** - where gas exchange occurs.\n2. **Lining of blood vessels** (endothelium) - facilitating smooth blood flow.\n3. **Lining of the heart** (endocardium) - providing a smooth surface for blood flow.\n4. **Lining of body cavities** (mesothelium) - such as the pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium.\n5. **Glomeruli of the kidneys** - involved in filtration.\n6. **Lining of the serous membranes** - which reduce friction between organs.\n\nThese locations highlight the role of simple squamous epithelium in processes such as diffusion, filtration, and providing a smooth surface for movement."}
