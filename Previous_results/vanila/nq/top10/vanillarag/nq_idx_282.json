{"question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "vanilla_rag_result": "The process that causes the continents to drift apart is known as plate tectonics. This theory explains that the Earth's lithosphere (the rigid outer layer) is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. The movement of these plates is driven by forces such as mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push.\n\nAs tectonic plates move, they can diverge from one another at mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed as magma rises to the surface. This process creates a gap between the plates, causing the continents that are situated on these plates to drift apart over geological time. Additionally, the interactions between plates at their boundaries can lead to various geological phenomena, including earthquakes and volcanic activity, further influencing the movement of continents.\n\nIn summary, the drifting of continents is primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates due to the dynamics of the Earth's mantle."}
