{"question": "what is the origin of the word celsius", "vanilla_rag_result": "The word \"Celsius\" is derived from the name of the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who developed the Celsius temperature scale in 1742. The scale is based on the freezing point of water at 0 degrees and the boiling point at 100 degrees under standard atmospheric conditions. Celsius's work contributed significantly to the field of thermometry, and his name has since been used to denote this widely adopted temperature scale."}
