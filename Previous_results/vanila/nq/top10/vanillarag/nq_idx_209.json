{"question": "who created the borders of africa's countries", "vanilla_rag_result": "The borders of Africa's countries were primarily created during the colonial period by European powers. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 is often cited as a significant event where European nations divided the continent among themselves without regard for the existing ethnic, cultural, or political boundaries. This arbitrary division has had lasting impacts on the continent's political and social landscape."}
