{"question": "what allows chyme to enter the small intestine", "vanilla_rag_result": "Chyme enters the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter, which is a muscular valve located at the lower end of the stomach. This sphincter regulates the passage of chyme from the stomach into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, allowing it to enter in a controlled manner."}
