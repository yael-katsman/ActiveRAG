{"question": "what percentage of the us population lives below the poverty line", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages you provided all relate to the percentage of the US population that lives below the poverty line, but they do not contain specific data or figures. To answer your question accurately, I would need the actual statistics from those passages. However, as of my last knowledge update in October 2023, the percentage of the US population living below the poverty line was approximately 11-12%. For the most current and precise figure, I recommend checking the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau or other reliable sources."}
