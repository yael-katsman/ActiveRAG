{"question": "who were the first non native settlers in the us", "vanilla_rag_result": "The first non-native settlers in what is now the United States were primarily European explorers and colonizers. The Spanish were among the earliest, establishing settlements in the 16th century, such as St. Augustine in Florida in 1565. The English followed, with Jamestown, Virginia, founded in 1607 being one of the first permanent English settlements. Other European nations, including the French and Dutch, also established colonies in North America during the 17th century."}
