{"question": "where does the cell spend most of its time in the cell cycle", "vanilla_rag_result": "The cell spends most of its time in the interphase stage of the cell cycle. Interphase is the period during which the cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and prepares for mitosis. It consists of three phases: G1 (first gap), S (synthesis), and G2 (second gap). Together, these phases account for the majority of the cell cycle duration."}
