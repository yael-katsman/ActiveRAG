{"question": "what does a heart rate of 131 mean", "vanilla_rag_result": "A heart rate of 131 beats per minute (bpm) typically indicates that the heart is beating faster than the normal resting rate, which is usually between 60 to 100 bpm for adults. This elevated heart rate can be a result of various factors, including physical activity, stress, anxiety, or medical conditions. \n\nIn a healthy individual, a heart rate of 131 bpm during exercise or physical exertion is generally considered normal and can reflect the body's response to increased demand for oxygen. However, if this heart rate occurs at rest or with minimal exertion, it may warrant further investigation to rule out underlying health issues such as dehydration, fever, or heart-related conditions.\n\nIt's important to consider the context in which the heart rate is measured, including the individual's overall health, fitness level, and any symptoms they may be experiencing. If there are concerns about a consistently high heart rate, consulting a healthcare professional is advisable for a thorough evaluation."}
