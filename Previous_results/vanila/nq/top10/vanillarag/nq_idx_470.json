{"question": "what is loihi and where does it originate from", "vanilla_rag_result": "Loihi is an underwater volcano located off the southeastern coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. It is part of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain and is considered to be the newest volcano in the Hawaiian archipelago. Loihi is still in the early stages of its formation and is gradually growing as lava erupts from its summit and builds up over time. As it continues to rise, it may eventually emerge above sea level, forming a new island in the future."}
