{"question": "who pays medical bills in great britain where does the money come from to pay these bills", "vanilla_rag_result": "In Great Britain, medical bills are primarily paid through the National Health Service (NHS), which is funded by taxation. The government collects taxes from individuals and businesses, and these funds are allocated to provide healthcare services to the population. This system allows residents to access medical care without direct charges at the point of use, meaning that most services are free for patients when they receive treatment. The funding model emphasizes collective responsibility for health care, ensuring that everyone has access to necessary medical services regardless of their financial situation."}
