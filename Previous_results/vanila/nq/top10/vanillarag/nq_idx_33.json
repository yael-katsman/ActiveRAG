{"question": "who helped them recapture mycenae once they were old enough to fight", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages all relate to the same topic, but they do not provide specific names or details about who helped them recapture Mycenae. Therefore, based on the information given, I cannot identify who helped them. If you have more specific details or context from the passages, I would be happy to help further!"}
