{"question": "what is the snow on mars made of", "vanilla_rag_result": "The snow on Mars is primarily made of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice. During the Martian winter, temperatures can drop low enough for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to freeze and fall as snow. Additionally, there may be some water ice present, but the predominant component of Martian snow is carbon dioxide."}
