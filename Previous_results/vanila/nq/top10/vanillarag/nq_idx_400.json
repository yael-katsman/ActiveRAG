{"question": "where does the sciatic nerve run in the foot", "vanilla_rag_result": "The sciatic nerve does not run directly in the foot. Instead, it originates in the lower back and travels down the leg, where it branches into two main nerves: the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve. These branches then continue to innervate various parts of the foot. The tibial nerve primarily supplies the plantar aspect (the bottom) of the foot, while the common peroneal nerve supplies the dorsum (the top) of the foot."}
