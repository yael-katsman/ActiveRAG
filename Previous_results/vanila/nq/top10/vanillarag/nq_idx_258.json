{"question": "when did the us dollar leave the gold standard", "vanilla_rag_result": "The US dollar officially left the gold standard in 1971 when President Richard Nixon announced the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold, a move often referred to as the \"Nixon Shock.\" This marked the end of the Bretton Woods system, which had established fixed exchange rates between currencies and gold."}
