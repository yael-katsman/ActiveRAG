{"question": "when did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit", "vanilla_rag_result": "The NCAA tournament became more important than the NIT (National Invitation Tournament) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This shift was largely due to the increasing popularity and visibility of the NCAA tournament, which began to attract more fans, media attention, and sponsorships, overshadowing the NIT. The NCAA tournament's expansion and the emergence of iconic moments and teams further solidified its status as the premier postseason event in college basketball."}
