{"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "vanilla_rag_result": "The practice of saying Mass in Latin largely ended with the Second Vatican Council, which took place from 1962 to 1965. The council introduced reforms that allowed for the use of vernacular languages in the liturgy, leading to the widespread adoption of local languages in place of Latin for Mass. The official implementation of these changes began with the publication of the new Roman Missal in 1970."}
