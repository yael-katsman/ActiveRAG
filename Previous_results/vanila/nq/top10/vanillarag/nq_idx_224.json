{"question": "where does fungi go on a food web", "vanilla_rag_result": "Fungi play a crucial role in food webs as decomposers. They break down organic matter, such as dead plants and animals, returning essential nutrients to the soil and making them available for producers like plants. This process helps sustain the ecosystem by recycling nutrients and supporting the growth of primary producers, which are at the base of the food web. Additionally, some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants (mycorrhizae), enhancing nutrient uptake for the plants while receiving carbohydrates in return. Thus, fungi occupy a vital position in food webs, primarily as decomposers and in mutualistic relationships with producers."}
