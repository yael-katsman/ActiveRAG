{"question": "how long do former presidents get secret service protection", "vanilla_rag_result": "Former presidents of the United States are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. However, this was not always the case; prior to 1994, former presidents received protection for only 10 years after leaving office. In 2013, legislation was enacted that restored lifetime protection for all former presidents, including those who served before the law was changed."}
