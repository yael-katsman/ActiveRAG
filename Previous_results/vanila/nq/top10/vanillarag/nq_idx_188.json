{"question": "who came up with popcorn at the movies", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages you provided all relate to the topic of who came up with popcorn at the movies, but they do not contain specific information. Based on general knowledge, popcorn became popular in movie theaters during the Great Depression, largely due to its low cost and the efforts of vendors who sold it outside theaters. One key figure often credited with popularizing popcorn in cinemas is Charles Cretors, who invented the first commercial popcorn machine in the late 19th century. However, the widespread adoption of popcorn in theaters was a collective effort by many vendors and theater owners."}
