{"question": "what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "vanilla_rag_result": "The first step in the evolution of the eye is typically thought to be the development of simple light-sensitive cells. These cells allowed organisms to detect light and dark, which provided a significant survival advantage by helping them navigate their environment. Over time, these simple structures evolved into more complex forms, leading to the diverse range of eyes seen in the animal kingdom today."}
