{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "vanilla_rag_result": "Hydrogen bonds can be found in various substances other than water. Some examples include:\n\n1. **Ammonia (NH3)** - Hydrogen bonds form between the hydrogen atoms of one ammonia molecule and the nitrogen atom of another.\n2. **Alcohols (such as ethanol)** - The hydroxyl (-OH) group in alcohols allows for hydrogen bonding between molecules.\n3. **Carboxylic acids** - These compounds can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.\n4. **DNA** - The base pairs in DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the structure of the double helix.\n5. **Proteins** - Hydrogen bonds play a significant role in stabilizing the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins.\n\nThese examples illustrate that hydrogen bonding is a common interaction in many biological and chemical systems beyond just water."}
