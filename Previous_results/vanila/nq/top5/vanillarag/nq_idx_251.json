{"question": "where does the president get authority to issue executive orders", "vanilla_rag_result": "The president derives the authority to issue executive orders from the Constitution and federal laws. Specifically, Article II of the Constitution grants the president the power to ensure that laws are faithfully executed. Additionally, Congress may delegate authority to the president through legislation, allowing for the issuance of executive orders to manage the operations of the federal government and implement laws. These orders can also be based on the president's inherent powers as the head of the executive branch."}
