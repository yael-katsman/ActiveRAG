{"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "vanilla_rag_result": "To determine when someone is considered under the poverty line, it typically depends on specific income thresholds set by government agencies, which can vary based on factors such as household size, location, and the cost of living. Generally, if an individual's or family's income falls below these established thresholds, they are classified as living in poverty. \n\nFor a more precise answer, it would be necessary to refer to the specific criteria and income levels outlined in the passages you provided. However, since the passages are not available for detailed analysis, the general understanding is that being under the poverty line is determined by income levels relative to the defined poverty thresholds."}
