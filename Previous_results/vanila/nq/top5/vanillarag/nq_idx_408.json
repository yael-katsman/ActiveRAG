{"question": "what is the first line of an http request to the server", "vanilla_rag_result": "The first line of an HTTP request to the server is known as the request line. It typically consists of three components: the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the requested resource (the URL or path), and the HTTP version being used (such as HTTP/1.1). An example of a request line would be:\n\n```\nGET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n``` \n\nThis line indicates that the client is requesting the resource located at `/index.html` using the GET method and is using HTTP version 1.1."}
