{"question": "when does the sa node begin electrical signaling", "vanilla_rag_result": "The SA node (sinoatrial node) begins electrical signaling at the start of each heartbeat. It generates electrical impulses that initiate the contraction of the heart muscle. This process typically begins in response to the body's need for increased blood flow, such as during physical activity or stress. The SA node is influenced by various factors, including autonomic nervous system signals and hormonal changes, which can affect the rate and timing of its electrical signaling."}
