{"question": "who were the first non native settlers in the us", "vanilla_rag_result": "The first non-native settlers in the United States were primarily European explorers and colonists. The Spanish were among the earliest, establishing settlements in the Southwest and Florida in the 16th century. The English followed, with Jamestown, Virginia, founded in 1607 being one of the first permanent English settlements. The French also established colonies in areas like Canada and the Mississippi River region. Overall, these European groups were the first non-native settlers to establish permanent communities in what would become the United States."}
