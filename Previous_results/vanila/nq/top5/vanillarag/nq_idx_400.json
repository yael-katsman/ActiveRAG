{"question": "where does the sciatic nerve run in the foot", "vanilla_rag_result": "The sciatic nerve does not run directly in the foot; rather, it travels down the leg and branches into two main nerves: the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve. The tibial nerve continues down to the sole of the foot, while the common peroneal nerve wraps around the fibula and branches into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves, which innervate different parts of the foot."}
