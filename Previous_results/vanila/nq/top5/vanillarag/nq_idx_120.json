{"question": "what are the main sources of economic growth in the us currently", "vanilla_rag_result": "To answer your question about the main sources of economic growth in the U.S. currently, I would need to analyze the content of the passages you mentioned. However, since the passages themselves are not provided, I can summarize general factors that are often cited as sources of economic growth in the U.S.:\n\n1. **Consumer Spending**: A significant driver of economic growth, as consumer expenditures account for a large portion of the GDP.\n\n2. **Business Investment**: Companies investing in new technologies, infrastructure, and equipment can lead to increased productivity and economic expansion.\n\n3. **Government Spending**: Public sector investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare can stimulate economic activity.\n\n4. **Exports**: Growth in international trade and exports can contribute to economic growth by opening new markets for U.S. goods and services.\n\n5. **Technological Innovation**: Advances in technology can enhance productivity and create new industries, driving growth.\n\n6. **Labor Force Participation**: An increase in the labor force, through population growth or higher participation rates, can contribute to economic growth.\n\n7. **Monetary Policy**: Central bank policies that influence interest rates and money supply can impact economic growth by affecting borrowing and spending.\n\nIf you can provide specific details or excerpts from the passages, I would be happy to give a more tailored response based on that information."}
