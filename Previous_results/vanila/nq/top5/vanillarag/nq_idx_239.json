It was used mainly for religious texts, monumental inscriptions, and official documents.\n\n2. **Hieratic**: This is a cursive form of hieroglyphics that was used for writing on papyrus and other materials. It was more practical for everyday writing and was commonly used by priests and scribes.\n\n3. **Demotic**: This script evolved from hieratic and was used for more secular documents. It became the common script for everyday writing in Egypt during the later periods.\n\nThese writing systems played a crucial role in administration, literature, and religious practices in ancient Egyptian society."}
