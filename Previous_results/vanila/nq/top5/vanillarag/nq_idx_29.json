{"question": "when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages you provided all relate to the same topic, but they do not contain specific information. However, based on general knowledge, aluminum wiring was commonly used in residential construction in Ontario until the mid-1970s. After that period, concerns about safety and performance led to a decline in its use, and by the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was largely phased out in favor of copper wiring. If you need more precise dates or details, please refer to specific building codes or regulations from that time."}
