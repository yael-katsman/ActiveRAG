{"question": "what does it mean to fuse the spine", "vanilla_rag_result": "Fusing the spine refers to a surgical procedure that aims to join two or more vertebrae together to eliminate movement between them. This is typically done to relieve pain, stabilize the spine, or correct deformities. The process involves using bone grafts, metal rods, screws, or other devices to encourage the vertebrae to heal into a single, solid bone. The fusion can help alleviate issues caused by conditions such as degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, or scoliosis. Overall, spinal fusion aims to provide stability and reduce discomfort in the affected area of the spine."}
