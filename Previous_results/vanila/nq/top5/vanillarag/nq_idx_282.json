{"question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "vanilla_rag_result": "The process that causes the continents to drift apart is known as plate tectonics. This involves the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is divided into several large and small tectonic plates. These plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them and can move due to convection currents caused by the heat from the Earth's interior. As these tectonic plates move, they can diverge, converge, or slide past one another, leading to the drifting of continents over geological time. This movement is responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges and the gradual separation of landmasses."}
