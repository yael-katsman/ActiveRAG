{"question": "who created the borders of africa's countries", "vanilla_rag_result": "The borders of Africa's countries were largely created during the colonial period by European powers. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 is often cited as a significant event in the establishment of these borders, as it formalized the division of Africa among various European nations without regard for the continent's ethnic, cultural, or linguistic divisions. As a result, many of the current borders reflect colonial interests rather than the historical or social realities of the African peoples."}
