{"question": "what is the snow on mars made of", "vanilla_rag_result": "The snow on Mars is primarily made of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice, also known as dry ice. In some regions, particularly at the poles, water ice can also be present. The unique atmospheric conditions on Mars allow for the formation of this CO2 snow, which behaves differently than snow on Earth."}
