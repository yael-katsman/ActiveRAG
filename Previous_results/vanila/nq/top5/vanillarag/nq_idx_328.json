{"question": "what does a heart rate of 131 mean", "vanilla_rag_result": "A heart rate of 131 beats per minute (bpm) typically indicates that the heart is beating faster than the normal resting rate, which is usually between 60 to 100 bpm for adults. This elevated heart rate can be a result of various factors, including physical activity, stress, anxiety, or medical conditions. In some contexts, such as during exercise, a heart rate of 131 may be considered normal and healthy. However, if this heart rate occurs at rest or is accompanied by other symptoms like dizziness or chest pain, it may warrant further medical evaluation. It's important to consider the individual's overall health, fitness level, and the context in which the heart rate is measured."}
