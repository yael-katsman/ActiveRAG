{"question": "what is loihi and where does it originate from", "vanilla_rag_result": "Loihi is an underwater volcano located off the southeastern coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. It is considered a new volcano that is still in the process of forming, and it is part of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. Loihi is significant because it provides insights into the geological processes that create islands in the Hawaiian archipelago. As it continues to grow, it may eventually emerge above sea level, becoming a new island in the future."}
