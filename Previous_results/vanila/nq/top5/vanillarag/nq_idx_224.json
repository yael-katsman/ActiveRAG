{"question": "where does fungi go on a food web", "vanilla_rag_result": "Fungi play a crucial role in food webs as decomposers. They break down organic matter, such as dead plants and animals, returning essential nutrients to the soil, which supports plant growth. This positions fungi at the base of the food web, where they contribute to nutrient cycling and energy flow. Additionally, some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants (mycorrhizae), enhancing nutrient uptake for the plants while receiving carbohydrates in return. Thus, fungi can be seen as both decomposers and mutualists within food webs."}
