{"question": "is jaffa cakes a biscuit or a cake", "vanilla_rag_result": "Jaffa Cakes are often the subject of debate regarding whether they are classified as a biscuit or a cake. The distinction can depend on various factors, including texture, ingredients, and legal definitions. \n\nIn the UK, a notable case in 1991 involved McVitie's, the manufacturer of Jaffa Cakes, which argued that they should be classified as cakes for tax purposes. The court ruled in favor of McVitie's, stating that Jaffa Cakes are indeed cakes because they are soft and sponge-like, similar to a cake, and they harden when stale, which is characteristic of cakes rather than biscuits.\n\nIn summary, while Jaffa Cakes may resemble biscuits in some aspects, they are legally classified as cakes."}
