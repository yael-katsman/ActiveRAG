{"question": "where can you find dna in the body", "vanilla_rag_result": "DNA can be found in several locations within the body, primarily in the following areas:\n\n1. **Nucleus of Cells**: The majority of DNA is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, where it is organized into chromosomes.\n\n2. **Mitochondria**: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is found in the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. This DNA is inherited maternally.\n\n3. **Chloroplasts**: In plant cells, DNA can also be found in chloroplasts, which are involved in photosynthesis.\n\n4. **Blood Cells**: DNA can be extracted from white blood cells, as they contain nuclei, while red blood cells do not have nuclei and therefore do not contain DNA.\n\n5. **Other Tissues**: DNA is present in various tissues throughout the body, including skin, muscle, and organs, as all cells (except mature red blood cells) contain a nucleus with DNA.\n\nIn summary, DNA is primarily found in the nucleus of cells, mitochondria, and in various tissues throughout the body."}
