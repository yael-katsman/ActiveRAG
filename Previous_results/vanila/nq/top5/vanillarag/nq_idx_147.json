{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "vanilla_rag_result": "Based on the passages provided, it seems that they all discuss substances other than water that exhibit hydrogen bonding. While the specific details from each passage are not included, common examples of substances that typically have hydrogen bonds include:\n\n1. **Ammonia (NH3)** - Hydrogen bonds form between the hydrogen atoms of one ammonia molecule and the nitrogen atom of another.\n2. **Hydrofluoric acid (HF)** - Hydrogen bonds can occur between the hydrogen atom of one HF molecule and the fluorine atom of another.\n3. **Alcohols (such as ethanol, C2H5OH)** - The hydroxyl (-OH) group in alcohols allows for hydrogen bonding.\n4. **Carboxylic acids (such as acetic acid, CH3COOH)** - These compounds can form hydrogen bonds due to their -COOH groups.\n5. **DNA and proteins** - The structures of DNA and proteins are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between their constituent molecules.\n\nIf you need more specific examples or details from the passages, please provide the content of those passages."}
