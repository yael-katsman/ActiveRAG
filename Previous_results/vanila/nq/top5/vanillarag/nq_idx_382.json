{"question": "what allows chyme to enter the small intestine", "vanilla_rag_result": "Chyme enters the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter, which is a muscular valve located at the junction of the stomach and the small intestine. The pyloric sphincter regulates the passage of chyme, allowing it to enter the small intestine in a controlled manner, ensuring that the digestive process continues efficiently."}
