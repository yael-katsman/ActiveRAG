{"question": "how long do former presidents get secret service protection", "vanilla_rag_result": "Former presidents receive Secret Service protection for life. However, this was not always the case; prior to 1994, former presidents were only entitled to protection for a limited time after leaving office. The law was changed to provide lifetime protection for all former presidents, although there are exceptions and specific conditions that may apply."}
