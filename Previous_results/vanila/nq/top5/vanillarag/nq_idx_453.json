{"question": "when did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit", "vanilla_rag_result": "The NCAA tournament became more important than the NIT in the late 1970s. This shift was largely due to the NCAA tournament's expansion and increased media coverage, which elevated its profile and prestige compared to the NIT.
