{"question": "who pays medical bills in great britain where does the money come from to pay these bills", "vanilla_rag_result": "In Great Britain, medical bills are primarily paid for by the National Health Service (NHS), which is funded through taxation. The money to pay for healthcare services comes from general taxation collected by the government, including income tax, value-added tax (VAT), and other forms of taxation. This system allows residents to access healthcare services without direct charges at the point of use, ensuring that medical care is available to all citizens regardless of their financial situation."}
