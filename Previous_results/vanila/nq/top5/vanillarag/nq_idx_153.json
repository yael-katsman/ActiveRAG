{"question": "is parallax more pronounced with nearby stars or with distant stars", "vanilla_rag_result": "Parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars. The apparent shift in position of a nearby star against the background of more distant stars is greater than that of distant stars, making it easier to measure the parallax of nearby stars."}
