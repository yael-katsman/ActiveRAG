{"question": "where does the sun hit the us first", "vanilla_rag_result": "The sun first hits the U.S. in the state of Alaska, specifically in the Aleutian Islands, which are located just west of the International Date Line. This means that when the sun rises, it does so first in these islands before it reaches the mainland of the United States."}
