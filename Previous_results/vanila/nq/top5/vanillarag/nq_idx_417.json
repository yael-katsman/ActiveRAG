{"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "vanilla_rag_result": "The practice of saying Mass in Latin officially ended with the Second Vatican Council, which took place from 1962 to 1965. The council's reforms led to the introduction of the vernacular languages in the liturgy, allowing Mass to be celebrated in the native languages of the congregations instead of exclusively in Latin. The changes were implemented gradually, with the new liturgical practices becoming more widespread in the years following the council."}
