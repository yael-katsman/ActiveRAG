{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "vanilla_rag_result": "The air gap on a dishwasher serves as a crucial component that prevents backflow of dirty water into the dishwasher from the sink or drainage system. It creates a physical barrier that ensures wastewater does not contaminate the clean water supply. By maintaining a separation between the dishwasher and the drain, the air gap helps to protect the dishwasher's internal components and ensures that dishes are cleaned effectively without the risk of reintroducing contaminants."}
