{"question": "When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?", "vanilla_rag_result": "When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind is the structure known as the corpus luteum. This temporary endocrine structure forms from the remnants of the follicle that housed the egg and is responsible for producing hormones, primarily progesterone, which are crucial for maintaining the uterine lining in preparation for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum eventually degenerates."}
