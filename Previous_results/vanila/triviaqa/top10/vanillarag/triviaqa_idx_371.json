{"question": "Where certain religions divide the notion of heaven into parts there are generally?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The question seems to be asking about the general concept of how certain religions categorize or divide the notion of heaven. While the specific content of the passages is not provided, it can be inferred that many religions have different interpretations of heaven, often dividing it into various realms or levels. \n\nFor example, in some belief systems, heaven may be divided into different tiers or spheres, each representing varying degrees of closeness to the divine or levels of reward for virtuous living. In other traditions, heaven might be seen as a singular paradise but with distinctions based on the nature of one's afterlife experience.\n\nIf you have specific details or themes from the passages, I could provide a more tailored response. However, based on the general understanding of religious concepts, the answer to your question would be that certain religions typically divide the notion of heaven into parts based on their theological beliefs, moral frameworks, and eschatological views."}
