{"question": "Which journalist first told the world about the My Lai massacre?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages you provided all relate to the same question about which journalist first reported on the My Lai massacre. However, since the content of the passages is not included, I cannot provide a specific answer based on that information. \n\nHistorically, the journalist who is often credited with first bringing the My Lai massacre to public attention is Seymour Hersh. He reported on the incident in 1969, which revealed the extent of the atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War. If you have specific details or excerpts from the passages, I can help analyze them further."}
