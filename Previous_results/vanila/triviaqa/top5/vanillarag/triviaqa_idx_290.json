{"question": "Who first drew Mickey Mouse when ?Disney first supplied the voice?", "vanilla_rag_result": "Based on the passages provided, it seems that they all relate to the same question about who first drew Mickey Mouse and when Disney first supplied the voice. However, since the content of the passages is not provided, I cannot give a specific answer. \n\nGenerally, Mickey Mouse was first drawn by Ub Iwerks in 1928, and Walt Disney provided the voice for Mickey Mouse starting with the character's first cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie,\" which was released on November 18, 1928. If you have specific details from the passages, I can help clarify further!"}
