{"question": "Who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War?", "vanilla_rag_result": "The passages you provided all relate to the same question about who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to their views on the Spanish Civil War. However, since the content of the passages is not provided, I cannot give a specific answer. \n\nHistorically, Andr\u00e9 Breton, the founder of the Surrealist movement, expelled the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed from the movement in 1939, partly due to Dal\u00ed's perceived indifference to the Spanish Civil War and his controversial political views. If you have specific details from the passages, I can help you analyze them further."}
