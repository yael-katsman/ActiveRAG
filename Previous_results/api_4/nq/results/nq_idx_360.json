{"question": "how many levels of protein structure are there", "api_result": "Proteins have four levels of structure:\n\n1. **Primary Structure**: This is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain, linked by peptide bonds. The primary structure determines all higher levels of protein structure.\n\n2. **Secondary Structure**: This involves the local folding of the polypeptide chain into structures such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms.\n\n3. **Tertiary Structure**: This is the overall three-dimensional structure of a single protein molecule. The tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions between side chains of the amino acids, including hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges.\n\n4. **Quaternary Structure**: This level of structure is present in proteins with multiple polypeptide chains (subunits). It refers to the arrangement and interaction of these subunits in a multi-subunit complex. \n\nEach level of structure is crucial for the protein's biological function and overall stability."}
