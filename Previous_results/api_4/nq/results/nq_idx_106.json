{"question": "who's playing in the world series and when is it", "api_result": "As of my last update, I don't have the current details on which teams are playing in the World Series or the exact dates for the games. The World Series typically takes place in late October, and the teams are determined by the winners of the American League and National League Championship Series. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking the latest sports news or the official MLB website."}
