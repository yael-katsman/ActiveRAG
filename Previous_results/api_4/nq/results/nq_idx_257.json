Dolmens are typically characterized by large stone slabs that are used to form chambers, which are often covered by a mound of earth or smaller stones. These structures were primarily used as burial sites and date back to the Neolithic period. Other forms of megalithic architecture in Europe include menhirs (standing stones) and stone circles, but dolmens are particularly widespread across the continent."}
