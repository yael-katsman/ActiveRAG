{"question": "why wasnt agent matthews in miss congeniality 2", "api_result": "In the movie \"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous,\" Benjamin Bratt, who played Agent Eric Matthews in the first \"Miss Congeniality\" film, did not return to reprise his role. The reason for this is not explicitly detailed in public sources, but it is common in the film industry for actors not to return to sequels for various reasons such as scheduling conflicts, contract negotiations, or creative differences. In the storyline of \"Miss Congeniality 2,\" it is mentioned that the character of Eric Matthews and Gracie Hart (played by Sandra Bullock) have broken up, which serves as a plot device to explain his absence and to allow the story to focus more on Gracie's professional and personal growth."}
