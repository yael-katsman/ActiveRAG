{"question": "who started the tradition of coloring easter eggs", "api_result": "The tradition of coloring Easter eggs has roots in various cultures and religions, with its origins often linked to early Christian practices. One popular legend attributes the start of this tradition to Mary Magdalene, a follower of Jesus. According to the legend, she was bringing cooked eggs to share with other women at Jesus' tomb when she discovered that he had risen, and the eggs in her basket miraculously turned bright red.\n\nHistorically, the practice of dyeing eggs predates Christianity. Ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, Persians, and Romans used colored eggs during their spring festivals as symbols of fertility and rebirth. As Christianity spread, early Christians in Mesopotamia adopted the custom, and it eventually became associated with Easter. The Eastern Orthodox Church, in particular, has a longstanding tradition of dyeing eggs red to symbolize the blood of Christ.\n\nThe tradition was further developed in Europe, particularly among Slavic peoples, who embraced the practice of decorating eggs with intricate designs using wax and dyes. These eggs, known as pysanky, are particularly famous for their detailed and colorful patterns.\n\nThus, while it's difficult to pinpoint a single individual who started the tradition of coloring Easter eggs, it can be seen as a blend of ancient customs and Christian symbolism that evolved over centuries across different cultures."}
