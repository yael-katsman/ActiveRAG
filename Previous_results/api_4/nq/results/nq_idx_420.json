{"question": "chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts", "api_result": "The chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts of the plant are known as \"plant hormones\" or \"phytohormones.\" These hormones are crucial in coordinating and regulating various aspects of plant growth and development. Some of the key plant hormones include:\n\n1. **Auxins**: These hormones promote stem elongation, inhibit growth of lateral buds (maintaining apical dominance), and are involved in the regulation of plant responses to light and gravity.\n\n2. **Cytokinins**: They stimulate cell division and growth, delay the aging of leaves, and, in conjunction with auxins, control the growth and differentiation of tissues.\n\n3. **Gibberellins**: These hormones promote stem elongation, help break seed dormancy, and stimulate some enzyme production (like amylases during germination).\n\n4. **Abscisic Acid (ABA)**: Often termed the \"stress hormone,\" ABA facilitates the closing of stomata, seed dormancy, and other stress responses.\n\n5. **Ethylene**: This gaseous hormone is involved in regulating the ripening of fruits, senescence of leaves, and the response of plants to mechanical stress.\n\n6. **Brassinosteroids**: These are important for cell expansion and division, shoot elongation, and vascular differentiation.\n\n7. **Jasmonates**: Involved in plant responses to stress and injury, these hormones also regulate developmental processes and defense responses against pathogens.\n\n8. **Salicylic Acid**: It plays a role in the plant's defense against pathogens and in the establishment of systemic acquired resistance.\n\nThese hormones can act locally at the site of synthesis or be transported to other parts of the plant, where they influence specific physiological processes."}
