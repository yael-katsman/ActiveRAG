{"question": "when does the world cup of hockey start", "api_result": "As of my last update in January 2023, there has not been an official announcement regarding the next World Cup of Hockey. The tournament does not have a fixed schedule and is organized sporadically. The last World Cup of Hockey was held in 2016, and there have been discussions about future tournaments, but specific dates or details had not been confirmed. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking with the official NHL website or other reliable sports news sources."}
