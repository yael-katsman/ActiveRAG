{"question": "who were the major countries involved in the cold war", "api_result": "The major countries involved in the Cold War were the United States and the Soviet Union. These two superpowers were the primary antagonists in the conflict, which lasted from roughly 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Cold War was characterized by political, military, and ideological rivalry but did not result in direct large-scale fighting between the two superpowers. Instead, it involved indirect conflicts through proxy wars, the arms race, and competition for influence around the world.\n\nOther countries played significant roles as allies or battlegrounds in this global struggle. NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) countries, including the United Kingdom, France, West Germany (and later a reunified Germany), Canada, and others, aligned with the United States. The Warsaw Pact, led by the Soviet Union, included Eastern European countries like East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.\n\nAdditionally, numerous non-aligned countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America became significant as both the U.S. and the Soviet Union sought to expand their influence in these regions through economic, military, and diplomatic means."}
