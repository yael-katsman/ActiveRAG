{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "api_result": "The air gap in a dishwasher is a crucial component designed to prevent contaminated water from siphoning back into the clean water supply. It serves as a physical barrier between the end of the dishwasher drain hose and the connection to the garbage disposal or drain pipe. Here\u2019s how it works and why it\u2019s important:\n\n1. **Preventing Contamination**: The primary function of the air gap is to ensure that dirty water from the dishwasher, which may contain food particles and other debris, does not flow back into the dishwasher or into your clean water supply. This is particularly important for maintaining sanitary conditions in your kitchen.\n\n2. **Breaking the Siphon Effect**: Without an air gap, there is a risk that water could be drawn back into the dishwasher if there's a sudden change in pressure in the drainage system. This could happen, for example, if there is a clog in the sewer system that creates negative pressure. The air gap prevents this by breaking the direct line of the hose that could potentially create a siphon.\n\n3. **Installation and Location**: Typically, an air gap is installed on the countertop or sink rim. It consists of a small fixture with two compartments separated by air. One hose runs from the dishwasher to the air gap, and another runs from the air gap to the garbage disposal or kitchen drain. The separation of these hoses by an air-filled space stops water from the sink or disposal from flowing back into the dishwasher.\n\n4. **Legal Requirements**: In many places, building codes require the installation of an air gap to meet plumbing standards for health and safety reasons. This ensures that all installations provide a physical barrier against potential contamination of the water supply.\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions**: In some cases, where an air gap is not installed, other methods like high loop installations of the drain hose (where the hose is looped at a high point under the kitchen sink) are used. However, these are generally considered less effective than an air gap in preventing backflow and are not allowed in some jurisdictions.\n\nOverall, the air gap is a simple yet essential safety feature that helps maintain the hygiene and functionality of your dishwasher and plumbing system."}
