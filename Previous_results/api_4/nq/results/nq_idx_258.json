{"question": "when did the us dollar leave the gold standard", "api_result": "The United States officially left the gold standard on August 15, 1971. This event is often referred to as the \"Nixon Shock,\" named after President Richard Nixon, who announced the suspension of the U.S. dollar's convertibility into gold. This decision effectively ended the Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange, which had been in place since the end of World War II and had established fixed exchange rates between the world's currencies and the U.S. dollar, with the dollar itself convertible to gold."}
