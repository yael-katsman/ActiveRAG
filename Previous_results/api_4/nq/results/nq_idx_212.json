{"question": "where was the last scene of the danish girl filmed", "api_result": "The last scene of \"The Danish Girl\" was filmed at the Nyhavn canal in Copenhagen, Denmark. This location is significant as it represents the setting where the real-life characters, Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, lived during part of their lives. The film, which is a fictionalized account of Lili Elbe's life as one of the first known recipients of sex reassignment surgery, uses this picturesque location to evoke the historical and emotional context of the story."}
