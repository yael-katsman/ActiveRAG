The document was influenced by the philosophical and political ideas of the Enlightenment, such as those of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu. It was officially passed by the National Constituent Assembly on August 26, 1789. This declaration was a fundamental document of the French Revolution and laid out a series of individual rights and collective rights of the people. It was a key step in the development of democracy and human rights not only in France but also in other parts of the world."}
