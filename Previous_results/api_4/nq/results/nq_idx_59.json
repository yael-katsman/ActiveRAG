{"question": "which greek god flew too close to the sun", "api_result": "It was not a Greek god who flew too close to the sun, but rather Icarus, a character from Greek mythology. Icarus was the son of Daedalus, a skilled craftsman who created wings made of feathers and wax for himself and his son to escape from the island of Crete. Despite his father's warnings, Icarus flew too close to the sun, causing the wax in his wings to melt. As a result, he fell into the sea and drowned. The story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and overambition."}
