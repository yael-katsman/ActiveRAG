{"question": "what was the religion in persia before islam", "api_result": "Before the advent of Islam, the dominant religion in Persia (modern-day Iran) was Zoroastrianism. This ancient religion, based on the teachings of the prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra), emerged in the region that is now Iran around the 6th century BCE. Zoroastrianism centers on the worship of Ahura Mazda, the wise lord, and emphasizes the cosmic struggle between the forces of order and chaos, represented by Spenta Mainyu (the Holy Spirit) and Angra Mainyu (the Destructive Spirit), respectively.\n\nZoroastrianism was the state religion of various Persian empires, most notably the Achaemenid (c. 550\u2013330 BCE), Parthian (247 BCE \u2013 224 CE), and Sasanian (224\u2013651 CE) empires. The religion included rituals such as the sacred fire, which was kept burning in temples, and the recitation of prayers from its holy texts, the Avesta.\n\nThe spread of Islam into Persia began in the 7th century CE, following the Arab conquest of the Sasanian Empire. Over the subsequent centuries, the majority of the population gradually converted to Islam, particularly to the Shia branch, which became dominant in Iran. However, a minority of Zoroastrians still remain in Iran and India (where they are known as Parsis) today."}
