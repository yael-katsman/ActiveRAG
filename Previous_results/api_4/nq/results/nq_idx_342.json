{"question": "a drug that might be used in surgery for its amnesic properties is", "api_result": "A drug commonly used in surgery for its amnesic properties is midazolam. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that is often administered to induce sedation, anxiolysis, and amnesia before or during surgical procedures. It helps patients to not remember the surgical experience, thereby reducing anxiety and discomfort associated with the memory of the procedure. Other similar drugs that might be used include other benzodiazepines like lorazepam or diazepam, and propofol, which also has amnesic effects."}
