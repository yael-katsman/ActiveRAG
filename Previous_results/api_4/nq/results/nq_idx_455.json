{"question": "who was the drummer with the travelling wilburys", "api_result": "The Traveling Wilburys did not have a specific, dedicated drummer in the traditional sense. The band was a supergroup composed of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. They often shared various responsibilities, including drumming and other instrumentation. Jim Keltner, a well-known session drummer, frequently collaborated with the group and is often associated with them as a supporting drummer, although he was not officially billed as a member of the band."}
