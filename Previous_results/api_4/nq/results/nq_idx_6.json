{"question": "input that tells the computer which task to execute is", "api_result": "Input that tells the computer which task to execute is typically referred to as a \"command\" or \"instruction.\" These inputs can be given to a computer in various forms, such as:\n\n1. **Command-Line Input**: This is text-based input where commands are typed into a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal. For example, typing `dir` in a Windows Command Prompt lists the contents of a directory.\n\n2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Input**: In GUIs, inputs are often given through interactions with graphical elements such as buttons, menus, and icons. For example, clicking on a \"Save\" icon in a word processor instructs the computer to save your document.\n\n3. **Programming Code**: When writing software, programmers provide instructions in the form of code, which the computer executes. For example, a line of code in Python like `print(\"Hello, world!\")` tells the computer to display the text \"Hello, world!\" on the screen.\n\n4. **API Calls**: In software development, applications interact with each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), where specific tasks are requested via API calls.\n\n5. **Script Files**: Scripts are sets of commands stored in a file, which can be executed to perform various tasks automatically. For example, a batch file in Windows or a shell script in Unix-like systems.\n\nEach of these inputs is processed by the computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit) or by specific software designed to handle such commands, ultimately leading to the execution of a task."}
