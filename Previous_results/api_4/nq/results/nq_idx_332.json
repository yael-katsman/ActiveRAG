{"question": "who coined the phrase let them eat cake", "api_result": "The phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is commonly attributed to Marie Antoinette, the queen of France during the French Revolution. However, there is no historical evidence to confirm that she actually said this. The phrase first appeared in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's autobiography, \"Confessions,\" which was written in 1766 when Marie Antoinette was only 11 years old and not yet queen. In the book, Rousseau attributes the phrase to \"a great princess,\" but does not name Marie Antoinette. It is likely that the phrase was used to symbolize the disconnect between the French nobility and the hardships of the common people, but it has been misattributed to Marie Antoinette over time."}
