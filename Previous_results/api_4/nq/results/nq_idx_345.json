{"question": "two examples where low voltage transformers are used", "api_result": "Low voltage transformers are commonly used in various applications to step down the voltage from a higher level to a safer, lower voltage. Here are two examples where low voltage transformers are typically used:\n\n1. **Landscape Lighting**: In residential and commercial landscaping, low voltage transformers are used to power outdoor lighting systems. These transformers convert the standard line voltage (usually 120V or 240V) to a much lower voltage, typically 12V or 24V. This lower voltage is safer for outdoor environments where moisture and human contact are common, reducing the risk of electrical shock. It also helps in reducing energy consumption and allows for the use of smaller, less expensive wiring.\n\n2. **Doorbell Systems**: In many homes, the doorbell system uses a low voltage transformer to reduce the household line voltage to a lower level, commonly 12V or 24V. This ensures safe operation of the doorbell, which is frequently located in areas accessible to occupants, including children. The lower voltage is sufficient to power the chime and the doorbell button without the risk of electrical hazards.\n\nThese examples highlight the importance of low voltage transformers in providing safety and functionality in everyday applications."}
