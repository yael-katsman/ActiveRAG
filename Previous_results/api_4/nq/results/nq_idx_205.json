{"question": "what part of the brain is in the middle cranial fossa", "api_result": "The middle cranial fossa, a depression in the floor of the cranial base, houses several important structures of the brain. Primarily, it contains parts of the temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex. Additionally, it accommodates the pituitary gland, which rests in the sella turcica, a depression in the sphenoid bone. The middle cranial fossa also contains important nerves and blood vessels that supply the brain. These include parts of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), specifically the ophthalmic nerve (V1) and maxillary nerve (V2), which pass through structures like the superior orbital fissure and foramen rotundum, respectively."}
