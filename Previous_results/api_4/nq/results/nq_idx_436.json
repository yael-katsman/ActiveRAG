{"question": "where do they put the tomb vampires in order to burn them during founders day", "api_result": "In the TV show \"The Vampire Diaries,\" during the Founders Day event, the plan was to use a device that emitted a high-pitched frequency to incapacitate the vampires, making them easier to capture. The captured vampires from the tomb were then placed in a building (specifically the old Gilbert building) with the intention of burning them inside to kill them. However, the plan did not go as intended, leading to various complications and consequences for the characters involved."}
