{"question": "what does a yellow 35 mph sign mean", "api_result": "A yellow 35 mph sign typically indicates an advisory speed limit for a specific section of road, such as a curve, hill, or other potentially hazardous condition. Unlike regulatory speed limit signs, which are usually white and enforceable by law, yellow speed limit signs are meant to advise drivers of a safe speed under normal conditions. It's recommended that drivers adhere to the speed indicated on these yellow signs to maintain safety, although they are not legally enforceable like the white speed limit signs."}
