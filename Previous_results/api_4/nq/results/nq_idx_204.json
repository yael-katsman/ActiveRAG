{"question": "when does the sa node begin electrical signaling", "api_result": "The sinoatrial (SA) node, often referred to as the natural pacemaker of the heart, begins electrical signaling as part of the normal cardiac cycle. The SA node is located in the right atrium of the heart. It generates electrical impulses that initiate each heartbeat.\n\nThe SA node fires at regular intervals, setting the pace for the heart rate. This electrical signal is generated spontaneously due to the unique properties of the cells within the SA node. These cells have the ability to depolarize automatically, a process known as automaticity.\n\nUpon generating an electrical impulse, the signal spreads through the walls of the atria, causing the atrial muscles to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. This process is known as atrial systole. The electrical signal then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, where it is briefly delayed before being relayed to the ventricles.\n\nIn summary, the SA node begins electrical signaling at the start of each cardiac cycle, leading to the contraction of the atria and the subsequent sequence of events that result in a heartbeat. The frequency of these impulses determines the heart rate and can vary based on physiological demands and other factors."}
