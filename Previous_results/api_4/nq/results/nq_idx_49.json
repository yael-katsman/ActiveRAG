{"question": "who is the current defence against the dark arts teacher", "api_result": "As of my last update in January 2023, the most recent information available comes from the \"Harry Potter\" series by J.K. Rowling, which concluded with the book \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\" In this book, the last known Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher mentioned is Amycus Carrow, who held the position during the 1997-1998 school year when Hogwarts was under the control of Lord Voldemort. However, Carrow's teaching focused more on dark arts than defending against them.\n\nAfter Voldemort's defeat, J.K. Rowling did not specify who took over the role in the books. Any updates or changes to the teaching staff at Hogwarts after the events of the original series would be speculative or based on additional writings, interviews with the author, or adaptations like plays or movies. For the most accurate and updated information, checking the latest official \"Harry Potter\" publications or J.K. Rowling's statements would be necessary."}
