{"question": "what is the corporate tax rate in great britain", "api_result": "As of my last update in 2023, the main rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom is 25%. This rate applies to companies with profits over \u00a3250,000. For companies with profits under \u00a350,000, a small profits rate of 19% applies. There is a marginal relief that provides a gradual increase in the effective corporation tax rate for profits between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3250,000. Please note that tax rates can change, so it's a good idea to check the latest information from official sources or consult a tax professional for the most current rates."}
