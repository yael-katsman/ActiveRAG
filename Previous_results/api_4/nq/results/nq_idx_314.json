{"question": "when did they start assigning social security numbers at birth", "api_result": "Social Security numbers began to be issued at birth in the United States in 1989 under the \"Enumeration at Birth\" process. This initiative was part of an effort to streamline the process of obtaining a Social Security number (SSN) for newborns. Prior to this, parents had to apply for an SSN for their child at a Social Security office. With the Enumeration at Birth program, parents could request an SSN for their newborn when they applied for the child's birth certificate. The hospital would then forward the information to the Social Security Administration, which would issue the SSN and mail the card directly to the parents. This made the process more convenient and helped ensure that children had SSNs from a very early age, which is useful for various purposes, including receiving government services, opening bank accounts, and applying for medical coverage."}
