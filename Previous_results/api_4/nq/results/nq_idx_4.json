{"question": "when did the first immigrants come to hawaii", "api_result": "The first immigrants to Hawaii were Polynesians from the Marquesas Islands, who are believed to have arrived in Hawaii around 300-600 AD. These early settlers were followed by Tahitians around 1000 AD, who became the dominant culture in Hawaii. The Polynesians were skilled navigators and traveled across the vast Pacific Ocean in double-hulled canoes, guided by the stars, ocean currents, and bird migrations.\n\nLater, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Hawaii saw a new wave of immigrants, including Europeans, Americans, and Asians (primarily Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, and Koreans), who came to work in the islands' developing sugar and pineapple industries. This later immigration significantly shaped Hawaii's cultural and demographic landscape."}
