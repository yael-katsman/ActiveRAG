{"question": "what is the revolution period of venus in earth years", "api_result": "The revolution period of Venus, which is the time it takes to complete one orbit around the Sun, is approximately 224.7 Earth days. To convert this period into Earth years:\n\n1 Earth year = 365.25 days (accounting for leap years)\n\nSo, the revolution period of Venus in Earth years is:\n\n224.7 days / 365.25 days per year \u2248 0.615 Earth years.\n\nTherefore, Venus completes one orbit around the Sun approximately every 0.615 Earth years."}
