{"question": "what allows chyme to enter the small intestine", "api_result": "Chyme is allowed to enter the small intestine from the stomach through a structure called the pyloric sphincter. The pyloric sphincter is a ring of smooth muscle located at the junction between the stomach and the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. This sphincter regulates the passage of chyme, controlling the flow and preventing backflow into the stomach. It opens periodically to allow small amounts of chyme to pass into the duodenum, facilitating digestion and absorption in the small intestine."}
