{"question": "computer based models of real life situation are called", "api_result": "Computer-based models of real-life situations are commonly referred to as \"simulations.\" These models use algorithms and computational techniques to imitate the behavior of real-world systems or processes. Simulations are widely used across various fields such as engineering, economics, medicine, and environmental science to study complex phenomena, make predictions, or test theories in a virtual environment."}
