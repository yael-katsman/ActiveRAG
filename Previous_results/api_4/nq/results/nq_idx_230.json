{"question": "when do primary ossification centers appear in an embryo", "api_result": "Primary ossification centers in an embryo generally begin to form during the fetal stage of development, around the 8th week of gestation. This process starts when mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts, which are cells that synthesize bone. These centers appear first in the long bones, such as the femur and tibia. The development of primary ossification centers is crucial for the formation of the initial bone structure in the developing fetus."}
