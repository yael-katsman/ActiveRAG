{"question": "when did the study of media effects begin", "api_result": "The study of media effects began to gain prominence in the early 20th century, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s. This period marked the rise of mass media, especially with the widespread adoption of radio and the growth of the film industry. Scholars and researchers started to investigate how these new forms of media were influencing public opinion, behavior, and society at large.\n\nOne of the earliest and most famous studies in this field was the Payne Fund Studies, conducted between 1929 and 1932, which examined the effects of movies on children. Another landmark in the early study of media effects was the work of Harold Lasswell, who in the 1920s and 1930s developed influential theories about media influence on public opinion and propaganda.\n\nThe interest in media effects continued to grow with the advent of television, leading to more systematic and empirical approaches in the mid-20th century, such as the cultivation theory developed by George Gerbner in the 1960s, which explored the long-term effects of television on viewers' perceptions of reality."}
