{"question": "what does the m number mean on a pint glass", "api_result": "The \"M number\" on a pint glass, often found alongside other markings such as the CE mark (indicating conformity with European standards), refers to the identification number of the manufacturer or the entity responsible for the certification of the glass. This number helps trace the origin of the glass and ensures that it meets specific standards for measuring volumes accurately.\n\nIn the context of pint glasses, particularly those used in commercial settings like pubs and restaurants in the UK and Europe, it's crucial that they provide accurate measurements to comply with laws regarding the serving of alcohol. The M number, along with other marks like the volume indication (e.g., pint or half-pint marks) and the CE mark, confirms that the glass has been tested and verified for this purpose. This system helps maintain standardization and fairness in serving sizes."}
