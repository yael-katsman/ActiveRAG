{"question": "where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery", "api_result": "When blood leaves the pulmonary artery, it travels to the lungs. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Origin from the Heart**: The pulmonary artery originates from the right ventricle of the heart. It is unique because it is one of the few arteries that carry deoxygenated blood.\n\n2. **Division**: The pulmonary artery divides into two main branches, the right and left pulmonary arteries, which correspond to the two lungs.\n\n3. **Entry into the Lungs**: Each pulmonary artery branch enters its respective lung.\n\n4. **Capillary Network**: Within the lungs, the pulmonary arteries further branch into smaller arterioles and eventually into capillaries. These capillaries are extremely fine and are spread extensively around the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs.\n\n5. **Gas Exchange**: In the capillaries, carbon dioxide is released from the blood into the alveoli, and oxygen is absorbed from the air in the alveoli into the blood. This process effectively oxygenates the blood.\n\n6. **Return to the Heart**: Once oxygenated, the blood is collected by the pulmonary veins (not arteries), which then transport it back to the left atrium of the heart. From there, it is pumped into the left ventricle and then out to the body through the aorta.\n\nThus, the primary function of the blood flow through the pulmonary artery is to receive oxygen in the lungs and release carbon dioxide, a critical process for maintaining the body's respiratory and circulatory functions."}
