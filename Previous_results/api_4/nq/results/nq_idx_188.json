{"question": "who came up with popcorn at the movies", "api_result": "The idea of selling popcorn at movie theaters was not the brainchild of a single individual, but rather a development that evolved over time. Popcorn itself has been a popular snack since the 19th century, thanks to its low cost and ease of production. It became a common street food, sold at fairs and other public events.\n\nThe introduction of popcorn into movie theaters in the United States happened during the Great Depression in the 1930s. During this time, theater owners were initially reluctant to sell popcorn and other snacks because they wanted to maintain an upscale and clean atmosphere. However, with the economic downturn, theater revenues were declining, and owners were looking for ways to boost their income.\n\nSome enterprising theater owners started to allow popcorn vendors to sell their snacks in the lobbies of theaters, or they leased lobby space to vendors. The low cost of popcorn made it an affordable treat for the cash-strapped public, and it quickly became a popular item. Theater owners noticed the popularity and profitability of popcorn and began installing their own popping machines.\n\nThis move significantly increased their profits, as popcorn has a high markup and was cheap to produce. Over time, popcorn became synonymous with movie watching, creating the classic combination we know today. Thus, the tradition of eating popcorn at the movies was more of an economic and cultural evolution rather than an invention by a specific person."}
