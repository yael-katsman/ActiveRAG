{"question": "who were the first non native settlers in the us", "api_result": "The first non-native settlers in what is now the United States were primarily from European countries, seeking new opportunities or fleeing religious persecution. The Spanish were among the earliest settlers, establishing St. Augustine in Florida in 1565, which is considered the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement within the borders of the continental United States.\n\nFollowing the Spanish, the French established settlements in areas that are now part of the U.S., including parts of Louisiana and the Mississippi River valley. The Dutch were also early settlers, founding New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan in 1626, which later became New York when taken over by the English.\n\nThe English established their first permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. This was followed by other English colonies, notably in Massachusetts where the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620.\n\nThese groups were the first significant waves of non-native settlers in the U.S., each bringing their own cultures, governance styles, and economic pursuits, profoundly influencing the development of the region."}
