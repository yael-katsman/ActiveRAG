{"question": "is parallax more pronounced with nearby stars or with distant stars", "api_result": "Parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars compared to distant stars. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of an object when viewed from different perspectives, and in astronomy, it is used to measure the distances to stars. The closer a star is to Earth, the larger its parallax shift will be when observed from two different points in Earth's orbit around the Sun. Conversely, the farther away a star is, the smaller its parallax shift, making it more challenging to measure accurately. This is why parallax measurements are most effective for determining the distances to relatively nearby stars."}
