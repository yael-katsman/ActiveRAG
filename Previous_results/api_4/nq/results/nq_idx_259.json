{"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "api_result": "The transition from black-and-white to color films began in the early 20th century. The first successful color process was Kinemacolor, which was introduced in 1908. However, it was not until the 1930s that color films started becoming more common, thanks to improved technologies like Technicolor. The first feature-length movie made in Technicolor was \"The Toll of the Sea\" from 1922, but it was \"Becky Sharp\" (1935) that marked the first full-length feature film using the three-strip Technicolor process, which produced more vibrant and realistic colors. The use of color in films became increasingly popular from the 1930s onward, with many classic films such as \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone with the Wind\" (both 1939) showcasing the technology. By the 1960s, color films had become the norm in the film industry."}
