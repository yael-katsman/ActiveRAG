{"question": "where does the this is us family live", "api_result": "As of the last update in my training data, the Pearson family from the TV show \"This Is Us\" primarily lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The show often features flashbacks and scenes set in other locations, but Pittsburgh is the main setting where the family's story unfolds, particularly in the house that Jack and Rebecca Pearson bought and raised their children in."}
