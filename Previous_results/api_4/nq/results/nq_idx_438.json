{"question": "who said i will not go quietly into the night", "api_result": "The phrase \"I will not go quietly into the night\" is often associated with the poem \"Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night\" by Dylan Thomas, written in 1947. However, the exact line from the poem is \"Do not go gentle into that good night.\" This poem is a villanelle and is considered one of Thomas's most famous works, urging the reader to \"rage, rage against the dying of the light.\"\n\nThe line you mentioned, \"I will not go quietly into the night,\" closely resembles a part of a speech from the 1996 movie \"Independence Day.\" In the film, the character President Thomas J. Whitmore, played by Bill Pullman, gives a motivational speech in which he says, \"We will not go quietly into the night!\" This speech is meant to rally the characters to fight against an alien invasion."}
