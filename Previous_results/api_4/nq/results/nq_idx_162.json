{"question": "who stole the mona lisa from the louvre in 1911", "api_result": "The Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre in 1911 by Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian handyman and painter. Peruggia, who had previously worked at the Louvre, managed to enter the museum during regular hours, hide until it was closed, and then remove the painting. He hid it in a trunk and walked out with it the next morning. His motivation was reportedly a misguided sense of patriotism; he believed that the painting should be returned to Italy. Peruggia kept the painting in his apartment for over two years before being caught when he attempted to sell it in Italy."}
