{"question": "who was the head of the spanish inquisition", "api_result": "The Spanish Inquisition, formally established in 1478 by Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, was led by several individuals over the years. The first Inquisitor General of the Spanish Inquisition was Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada, who served from 1483 until his death in 1498. Torquemada was known for his severe methods and significant role in the persecution of Jews, Muslims, and suspected heretics in Spain. After Torquemada, the position was held by various other figures, each contributing to the continuation of the Inquisition's activities until its eventual abolition in the early 19th century."}
