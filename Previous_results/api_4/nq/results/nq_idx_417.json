{"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "api_result": "The practice of saying Mass in Latin began to change significantly with the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). One of the key outcomes of this council was the permission for the Mass to be celebrated in the vernacular, or the local language, instead of Latin. This change was officially promulgated by Pope Paul VI in the document \"Sacrosanctum Concilium,\" promulgated on December 4, 1963. The use of the vernacular languages in the Mass began to be implemented more widely after 1964, though the transition period varied widely among different regions and parishes. Latin has not been entirely abandoned and is still used in some contexts, particularly in the traditional Latin Mass, also known as the Tridentine Mass."}
