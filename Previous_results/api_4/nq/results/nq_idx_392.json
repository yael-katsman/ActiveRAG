{"question": "what is the rank of india in economic growth", "api_result": "As of my last update in 2023, I don't have the specific rank of India in terms of economic growth globally for this year. Economic growth rankings can vary based on different metrics and sources such as GDP growth rate, GDP per capita growth, etc. These rankings are typically published by various financial institutions and economic research bodies like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or global economic reports.\n\nFor the most current and specific ranking, I recommend checking the latest reports from these organizations or global economic databases that track real-time economic indicators and forecasts."}
