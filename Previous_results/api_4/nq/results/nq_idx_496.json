This campaign began in late August with the Battle of Long Island (also known as the Battle of Brooklyn), where British forces, under the command of General William Howe, defeated the American troops led by General George Washington. Following this victory, the British continued to take control of New York City, which served as a strategic base for the British for much of the war."}
