{"question": "what is the breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from atp", "api_result": "When one phosphate group is removed from ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule is converted into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and a free inorganic phosphate group (Pi). This reaction is typically catalyzed by enzymes known as ATPases and is accompanied by the release of energy, which is utilized by the cell for various energy-requiring processes. The reaction can be represented as:\n\n\\[ \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{ADP} + \\text{Pi} \\]"}
