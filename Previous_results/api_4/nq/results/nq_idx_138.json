{"question": "cls bank deals with transactions arising out of", "api_result": "CLS Bank, also known as CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement), primarily deals with the settlement of foreign exchange transactions. It was established to mitigate the settlement risk associated with cross-border currency trades. The primary function of CLS is to eliminate the risk that one party to a transaction will deliver the currency it sold but not receive the currency it bought, a risk known as \"settlement risk\" or \"Herstatt risk.\"\n\nCLS operates by implementing a process called 'payment versus payment' (PvP), which ensures that the final transfer of one currency occurs if and only if the final transfer of the other currency also takes place. This simultaneous settlement mechanism is crucial for financial stability, as it significantly reduces the risk that one party fails to deliver the currency after receiving the payment from the counterparty.\n\nCLS settles transactions in multiple currencies, covering a significant portion of the global foreign exchange market. Its members include major financial institutions, and it operates under the oversight of central banks of the currencies it settles. The system helps in enhancing the efficiency and security of foreign exchange markets, supporting global trade and investment by reducing the risks associated with currency exchanges."}
