{"question": "who holds the record for most platinum albums", "api_result": "As of my last update in 2023, the record for the most platinum albums by a solo artist is held by Elvis Presley, with a significant number of his albums certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In terms of groups, The Beatles also hold a similar record, with numerous albums achieving platinum status. These records are subject to change as new albums are released and existing albums continue to sell, so it's a good idea to check the latest data from the RIAA or similar organizations for the most current information."}
