{"question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "api_result": "The process that causes continents to drift apart is called plate tectonics. This theory explains the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is divided into several large and small plates. These tectonic plates float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them.\n\nThe primary mechanism behind the drifting of continents is the movement of these tectonic plates. There are three main types of plate boundaries where different movements occur:\n\n1. **Divergent boundaries**: At these boundaries, tectonic plates move away from each other. As the plates separate, magma from the mantle rises to fill the gap, creating new crust as it cools and solidifies. This process is most prominently observed at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it leads to the formation of new oceanic crust and the widening of the ocean basin, causing the continents on either side to drift apart.\n\n2. **Convergent boundaries**: Here, plates move towards each other. Depending on the nature of the plates involved (oceanic or continental), this can lead to subduction (where one plate moves under another) or continental collision (like the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate forming the Himalayas).\n\n3. **Transform boundaries**: At these boundaries, plates slide past each other horizontally. This movement can cause earthquakes but does not typically result in the creation or destruction of crust, and thus does not directly contribute to continental drift.\n\nThe concept of continental drift was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, and it was later explained through the theory of plate tectonics in the mid-20th century. This theory not only explains the movement of continents but also accounts for various other geological phenomena, including earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountain ranges."}
