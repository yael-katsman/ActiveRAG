{"question": "who named all the animals in the world", "api_result": "The naming of animals in the world is a process that has evolved over centuries and involves many cultures, scientists, and naturalists. However, if you are referring to the biblical context, it is said that Adam, the first human according to the Bible, named all the animals. This account is found in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, where God brings the animals to Adam to see what he would call them, and whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name.\n\nIn a scientific context, the formal system of naming species is called binomial nomenclature, and it was developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician, is often referred to as the father of modern taxonomy. His system for naming, ranking, and classifying organisms is still in wide use today (with many refinements), and it deals with the naming of all forms of life, including animals."}
