{"question": "where does prime rib come from on a cow", "api_result": "Prime rib, also known as a standing rib roast, comes from the rib section of a cow. Specifically, it is sourced from the primal rib, one of the nine primary beef primal cuts. The rib section spans from ribs six through twelve on the cow. Prime rib is known for its rich flavor, juiciness, and tender texture, which is enhanced by the marbling of fat throughout the meat. This cut is particularly popular for roasting, often served as a centerpiece for special occasions and holiday meals."}
