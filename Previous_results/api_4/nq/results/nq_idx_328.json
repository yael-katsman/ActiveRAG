{"question": "what does a heart rate of 131 mean", "api_result": "A heart rate of 131 beats per minute (bpm) can indicate different things based on the context in which it is measured. Here are a few scenarios to consider:\n\n1. **During Exercise:** If this heart rate is measured during physical activity, it might be perfectly normal. The heart rate increases during exercise to supply more oxygen to the muscles. The normal range during exercise varies widely depending on age, fitness level, type of exercise, and individual health.\n\n2. **At Rest:** A resting heart rate of 131 bpm is considered high (normal resting heart rates range from 60 to 100 bpm for adults). A consistently high resting heart rate can indicate an underlying condition or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It's often referred to as tachycardia when the heart rate exceeds 100 bpm at rest.\n\n3. **Emotional States:** Strong emotions like anxiety, stress, or fear can also temporarily increase the heart rate.\n\n4. **Health Conditions:** Several conditions can cause a high heart rate, including heart rhythm disorders, hyperthyroidism, fever, anemia, dehydration, and more.\n\n5. **Medications or Substances:** Certain medications, caffeine, nicotine, or other stimulants can elevate the heart rate.\n\nIf you or someone else has a heart rate of 131 bpm and it's not clearly linked to physical activity or an emotional state, it's advisable to consult a healthcare provider to determine the cause, especially if accompanied by symptoms like dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Regular monitoring and a professional evaluation are important to ensure proper health management."}
