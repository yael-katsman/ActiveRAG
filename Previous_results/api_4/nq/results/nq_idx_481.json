{"question": "term limits for house of representatives and senate", "api_result": "In the United States, members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms, with no limits on the number of terms they can serve. Senators serve six-year terms and are also not subject to term limits. This means that both representatives and senators can be re-elected an unlimited number of times as long as they continue to win their elections."}
