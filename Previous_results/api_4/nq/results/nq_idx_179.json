{"question": "what is the largest bill in american money", "api_result": "As of my last update in 2023, the largest denomination of currency currently issued for public circulation in the United States is the $100 bill. However, historically, the U.S. has issued larger denominations, primarily for use between banks and not for general circulation. These included $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills. Additionally, a $100,000 gold certificate was issued in 1934, but it was used only for transactions between Federal Reserve Banks and was not circulated among the general public."}
