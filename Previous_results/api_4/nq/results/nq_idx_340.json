{"question": "what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "api_result": "The first step in the evolution of the eye is generally considered to be the development of a simple photosensitive spot. This primitive form of light sensitivity, found in some unicellular organisms and simple multicellular organisms, consists of photoreceptor cells that can detect light but cannot form images. These photosensitive cells are crucial because they provide the organism with the ability to sense light intensity and direction, which can be important for behaviors like phototaxis (movement toward or away from light). This basic capability is thought to have gradually evolved into more complex eye structures capable of image formation in higher organisms."}
