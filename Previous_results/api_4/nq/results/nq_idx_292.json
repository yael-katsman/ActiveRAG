{"question": "what do mobile numbers start with in the uk", "api_result": "In the United Kingdom, mobile phone numbers typically start with the digits \"07.\" The format for mobile numbers is generally expressed as: \n\n- 07XXX YYY YYY\n\nHere, \"07\" indicates that it is a mobile number, followed by a three-digit code (XXX) which can help identify the mobile network operator, though number portability can obscure the original network. The remaining six digits (YYY YYY) are the unique number assigned to the subscriber.\n\nFor example, numbers might start with 071, 072, 073, 074, 075, 076 (mostly for pagers), 077, 078, or 079. Each of these is followed by further digits to complete the number."}
