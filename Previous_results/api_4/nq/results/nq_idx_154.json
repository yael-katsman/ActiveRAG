{"question": "who led the soldiers in ending the raid on the harper's ferry arsenal", "api_result": "The raid on Harpers Ferry, which occurred in October 1859, was led by abolitionist John Brown. The raid was aimed at seizing the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia), to incite a slave rebellion. However, the raid was quickly suppressed by local citizens and militia, and then by U.S. Marines led by Colonel Robert E. Lee, who was a lieutenant colonel at the time and on leave from the Texas frontier. Lee's forces succeeded in capturing John Brown and several of his men, effectively ending the raid."}
