{"question": "who created the borders of africa's countries", "api_result": "The borders of Africa's countries were largely shaped during the period known as the \"Scramble for Africa,\" which occurred between 1881 and 1914. This period was marked by intense competition among European powers for territorial control over the African continent. The key event that formalized the division of Africa among European nations was the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, where representatives from major European countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Portugal, convened to establish rules for the colonization and partition of Africa. These borders were often drawn without regard to the ethnic, cultural, or linguistic boundaries of the indigenous populations, leading to many of the conflicts and challenges faced by African nations today."}
