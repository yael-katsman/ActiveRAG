{"question": "where did the butchers in the slaughterhouse cases live", "api_result": "The Slaughterhouse Cases, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1873, involved butchers from New Orleans, Louisiana. These cases arose after Louisiana passed a law in 1869 creating a state-sanctioned monopoly for slaughterhouse operations in New Orleans, which required all butchers in the city to use a single, centralized slaughterhouse owned by the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughterhouse Company. The butchers affected by this law were primarily local to the New Orleans area."}
