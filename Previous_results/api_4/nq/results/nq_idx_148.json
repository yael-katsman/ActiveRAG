{"question": "what is the full form of cfc's", "api_result": "The full form of CFCs is Chlorofluorocarbons. Chlorofluorocarbons are a group of man-made compounds containing chlorine, fluorine, and carbon. They were commonly used in air conditioning, refrigeration, aerosol propellants, and foam blowing agents due to their stability and low toxicity. However, it was discovered that CFCs contribute to ozone layer depletion in the stratosphere, leading to their phased-out production and usage under the Montreal Protocol."}
