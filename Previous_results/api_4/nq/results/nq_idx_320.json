{"question": "how many times have real madrid won the champions league in a row", "api_result": "As of my last knowledge update in 2023, Real Madrid has won the UEFA Champions League three times in a row on two separate occasions. The first streak was from 1956 to 1960, when they won the first five editions of the tournament (then known as the European Cup). The second streak was more recent, from 2016 to 2018, under the management of Zinedine Zidane."}
