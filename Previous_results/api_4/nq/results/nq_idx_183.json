{"question": "who caused to build qutub minar in delhi", "api_result": "Qutub Minar in Delhi was commissioned by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1193. He started the construction of the minaret as a victory tower to celebrate Muslim dominance in Delhi after the defeat of Delhi's last Hindu ruler. However, Qutb-ud-din Aibak only built the base of the Qutub Minar, and the construction was later taken over and completed by his successor, Iltutmish, and further enhancements were made by Firoz Shah Tughlaq in the 14th century."}
