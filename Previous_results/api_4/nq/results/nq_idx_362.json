{"question": "what is the emblematic rhythm of dominican republic", "api_result": "The emblematic rhythm of the Dominican Republic is merengue. Merengue is a fast-paced, lively dance music that originated in the Dominican Republic in the 19th century. It is characterized by its upbeat tempo and the use of instruments such as the accordion, saxophone, and tambora (a two-sided drum). Alongside merengue, bachata is another popular music genre from the Dominican Republic, known for its romantic themes and slower, more melodic pace. Both rhythms are integral to the Dominican cultural identity and are celebrated both nationally and internationally."}
