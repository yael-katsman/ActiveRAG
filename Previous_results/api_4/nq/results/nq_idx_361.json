{"question": "when was the cat and mouse act introduced", "api_result": "The Cat and Mouse Act, formally known as the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act, was introduced in 1913. This British law was enacted on April 25, 1913, as a response to the hunger strikes by suffragettes who were demanding the right to vote. The act allowed for the temporary release of prisoners who were so weakened by hunger striking that they were at risk of death. They could be re-arrested and returned to prison once they had recovered sufficiently to serve out the remainder of their sentences. This act was intended to prevent the death of prisoners while still keeping them under control, and it was derisively nicknamed the \"Cat and Mouse Act\" because it allowed the authorities to play a cat-and-mouse game with the suffragettes."}
