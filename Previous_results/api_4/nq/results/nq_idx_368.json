{"question": "what was the most important new religious figure of the new kingdom of ancient egypt", "api_result": "The most important new religious figure of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt was the god Amun, particularly in his combined form as Amun-Ra. During the New Kingdom period, which lasted from about 1550 to 1070 BCE, Amun rose to prominence and became the chief deity in the Egyptian pantheon.\n\nOriginally a local god of Thebes, Amun's importance grew as the city of Thebes became the political capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom. His identity was merged with that of Ra, the ancient sun god, forming Amun-Ra. This syncretism elevated him to a position of supreme deity, often referred to as the \"King of the Gods.\"\n\nAmun-Ra was central to Egyptian religion and state ideology during this period. He was worshipped as a god of the sun, creation, fertility, and the ruler of the gods. The massive temple complex at Karnak, dedicated primarily to Amun-Ra, is one of the most significant religious centers from ancient Egypt and reflects his immense importance.\n\nThe pharaohs of the New Kingdom, such as Hatshepsut, Amenhotep III, and Ramesses II, often emphasized their close relationship with Amun-Ra in their religious practices and monumental inscriptions, further solidifying his status as a pivotal figure in the religious landscape of New Kingdom Egypt."}
