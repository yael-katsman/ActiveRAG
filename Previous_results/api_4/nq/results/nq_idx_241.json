{"question": "when does the dlc for rainbow six siege come out", "api_result": "As of my last update in January 2023, the release dates for DLCs in Rainbow Six Siege can vary and are typically announced by Ubisoft ahead of each new season. Rainbow Six Siege usually follows a pattern of releasing four major updates or \"seasons\" each year. Each season often introduces new operators, maps, or significant game changes and is accompanied by a DLC.\n\nTo find the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the release of any upcoming DLC for Rainbow Six Siege, I recommend checking the official Rainbow Six Siege website or Ubisoft's official communications such as their social media channels, blog posts, or forums. These platforms will provide official announcements and details about release dates, content included in the DLC, and any other pertinent information."}
