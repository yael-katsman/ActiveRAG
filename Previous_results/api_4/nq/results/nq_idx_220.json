{"question": "who has won the most united states championships", "api_result": "As of my last update in 2023, the wrestler with the most reigns as United States Champion in WWE history is Ric Flair. He has held the title a total of 6 times. This record considers his reigns with the title when it was under the NWA (National Wrestling Alliance) banner, before the title was integrated into WWE. In WWE specifically, other wrestlers like John Cena have also had significant numbers of reigns with the United States Championship. Cena, for example, has won the WWE version of the United States Championship 5 times."}
