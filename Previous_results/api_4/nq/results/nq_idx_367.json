{"question": "what information is displayed in clear text from the ftp header", "api_result": "FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP does not inherently encrypt its traffic, and as such, most information transmitted during an FTP session, including the header information, is sent in clear text. This can include:\n\n1. **Username and Password**: During the authentication phase, the username and password are transmitted in clear text unless explicit security measures like FTPS (FTP Secure) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) are used.\n\n2. **Commands and Responses**: All commands sent from the client to the server (such as `LIST`, `RETR`, `STOR`, etc.) and the responses from the server are transmitted in clear text. This includes status codes and messages that indicate the results of the commands.\n\n3. **Data (File and Directory Information)**: The actual data, including file contents and directory listings, are also transmitted in clear text unless the connection is encrypted.\n\n4. **Control Information**: This includes any other protocol-related messages and session setup information.\n\nBecause of these security concerns, it's recommended to use more secure alternatives like FTPS or SFTP, which provide encryption to protect data transmitted over the network. FTPS adds support for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocols to FTP, while SFTP uses the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to encrypt all data transfers."}
