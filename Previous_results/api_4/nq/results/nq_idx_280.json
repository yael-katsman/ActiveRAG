{"question": "when did the legal drinking age changed to 21", "api_result": "In the United States, the legal drinking age was changed to 21 nationwide with the enactment of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on July 17, 1984. This law required all states to raise their minimum purchase and public possession of alcohol age to 21 by October 1986 or face a reduction in highway funds under the Federal-Aid Highway Act. States gradually complied, and by 1988, all states had laws setting the minimum legal drinking age to 21."}
