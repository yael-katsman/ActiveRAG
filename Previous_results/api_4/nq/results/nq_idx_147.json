{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "api_result": "Hydrogen bonds are a type of weak chemical bond that is common in many substances, particularly those involving hydrogen and highly electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, and fluorine. Here are some examples of substances and molecules other than water that feature hydrogen bonds:\n\n1. **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: Hydrogen bonds can form between the nitrogen atom of one ammonia molecule and the hydrogen atom of another.\n\n2. **DNA**: Hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in the structure of DNA, holding together the nitrogenous bases of the DNA strands. For example, adenine pairs with thymine via two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine pairs with guanine via three hydrogen bonds.\n\n3. **Proteins**: Hydrogen bonding is critical in maintaining the secondary structure of proteins, such as alpha helices and beta sheets. These bonds occur between the backbone amide hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen in the peptide chain.\n\n4. **Alcohols (e.g., ethanol)**: Hydrogen bonds can form between the hydrogen of one hydroxyl group and the oxygen of another hydroxyl group in different alcohol molecules.\n\n5. **Carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic acid)**: These molecules can form strong hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group, which can interact with similar groups on other molecules.\n\n6. **Water solutions containing solutes like sugars and salts**: These solutes can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, affecting properties like boiling point and viscosity.\n\n7. **Fluorine-containing compounds**: Like hydrogen fluoride (HF), where hydrogen bonds occur between the hydrogen of one molecule and the fluorine of another.\n\n8. **Organic compounds containing N-H groups**: Such as amides and urea, where hydrogen bonds can form between the nitrogen-bound hydrogen and an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen in another molecule.\n\nThese examples illustrate the versatility and importance of hydrogen bonds in various chemical and biological systems, influencing properties like solubility, boiling point, and structural stability."}
