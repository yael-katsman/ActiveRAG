This includes the authority to discipline judges of lower courts and, in a broader sense, manage the judiciary.\n\n5. **Rule-Making Power**: The Supreme Court has the power to promulgate rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, and the admission to the practice of law. The Court's rules must provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases.\n\n6. **Temporary Assignment of Judges**: The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has the power to assign temporarily judges of lower courts to other stations as public interest may require. Such temporary assignment shall not exceed six months without the consent of the judge concerned.\n\n7. **Appointment Powers**: While the President of the Philippines appoints the Justices of the Supreme Court, the Court itself has significant appointive powers. It appoints all officials and employees of the judiciary.\n\n8. **Deciding Presidential Election Contests**: The Supreme Court, sitting en banc, shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the President or Vice-President, and may promulgate its rules for the purpose.\n\nThese powers ensure that the Supreme Court plays a crucial role in maintaining the rule of law and constitutional governance in the Philippines."}
