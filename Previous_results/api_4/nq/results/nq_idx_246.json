{"question": "when did ireland gain its independence from england", "api_result": "Ireland gained independence from the United Kingdom through a series of events in the early 20th century. The key dates are as follows:\n\n1. **1916:** The Easter Rising, an armed insurrection against British rule, took place, but it was quickly suppressed.\n\n2. **1919-1921:** The Irish War of Independence was fought between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and British forces.\n\n3. **1921:** The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on December 6, 1921, which ended the war and established the Irish Free State as a dominion within the British Commonwealth, with partial independence from the United Kingdom.\n\n4. **1949:** The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 came into effect on April 18, 1949, and the country was declared a republic, officially leaving the British Commonwealth and severing all remaining constitutional links with the United Kingdom.\n\nThus, while the Irish Free State gained a significant level of autonomy in 1922, it was not until 1949 that Ireland became fully independent as a republic."}
