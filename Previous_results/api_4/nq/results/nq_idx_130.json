{"question": "what states do not allow daylight savings time", "api_result": "As of my last update in 2023, the states in the United States that do not observe Daylight Saving Time are Hawaii and most of Arizona. Hawaii does not observe it because its tropical latitude results in relatively consistent day lengths year-round. In Arizona, the decision not to observe Daylight Saving Time is primarily due to the extreme heat that would be exacerbated by an additional hour of sunlight in the evening. However, the Navajo Nation, which spans parts of northeastern Arizona, does observe Daylight Saving Time to maintain uniformity across its territory, which also extends into Utah and New Mexico."}
