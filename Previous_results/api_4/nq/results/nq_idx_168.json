{"question": "what is the origin of the word celsius", "api_result": "The word \"Celsius\" originates from the name of the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744). Celsius is most famous for his creation of the Celsius temperature scale, which he introduced in 1742. The Celsius scale, originally called centigrade (from Latin \"centum\" meaning 100 and \"gradus\" meaning steps), was a revolutionary way to measure temperature with 100 degrees between the freezing and boiling points of water.\n\nThe term \"Celsius\" became associated with the temperature scale as a way to honor Anders Celsius after his death. Over time, the scale was commonly referred to as Celsius rather than centigrade, particularly after it was adopted internationally as the standard temperature scale in various scientific contexts. The name change from centigrade to Celsius was more widely accepted and promoted during the 20th century, especially after the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1948 officially adopted \"degree Celsius\" (symbol \u00b0C) as the unit of temperature."}
