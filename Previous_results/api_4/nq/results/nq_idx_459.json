{"question": "who were the two mathematicians that invented calculus", "api_result": "Calculus, a fundamental branch of mathematics, was independently developed by two mathematicians: Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Their respective contributions to calculus were made in the late 17th century. While Newton, an English mathematician, focused on the concepts of fluxions and fluents, Leibniz, a German mathematician, developed the notation and the differential and integral calculus that are still in use today. Their independent discoveries led to a significant controversy over who invented calculus first, a dispute that persisted for many years."}
