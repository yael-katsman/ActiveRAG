{"question": "who is the ceo of what's up", "api_result": "As of my last update in September 2023, WhatsApp does not have a CEO because it is a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook, Inc.). The CEO of Meta Platforms is Mark Zuckerberg. WhatsApp is typically managed by a head or director within the organization, rather than having a separate CEO. For specific and current leadership roles within WhatsApp, it's best to check the latest updates directly from Meta Platforms or official WhatsApp announcements."}
