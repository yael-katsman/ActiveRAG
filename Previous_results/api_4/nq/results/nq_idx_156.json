{"question": "who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition", "api_result": "The twelve-tone system, also known as dodecaphony or twelve-tone serialism, was developed by Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg in the early 1920s. This system was a radical departure from traditional harmony, as it sought to avoid the dominance of any one key and instead treated all twelve tones of the chromatic scale as equal. Schoenberg's development of this technique was part of his broader exploration into atonality and was influential in shaping much of the music of the 20th century, impacting composers in both classical and avant-garde circles."}
