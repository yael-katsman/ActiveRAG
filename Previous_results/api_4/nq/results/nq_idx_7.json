{"question": "what's in a beam me up scotty", "api_result": "The \"Beam Me Up Scotty\" cocktail is a playful nod to the famous catchphrase from \"Star Trek,\" although it's worth noting that the exact phrase \"Beam me up, Scotty\" was never actually said in the original series. The drink itself is a potent mix, typically made with the following ingredients:\n\n- 1/2 oz. Vodka\n- 1/2 oz. Rum\n- 1/2 oz. Scotch\n- 1/2 oz. Banana liqueur\n- 1/2 oz. Baileys Irish Cream\n- 1/2 oz. Half-and-half (or cream)\n\nTo make the cocktail, combine all the ingredients in a shaker with ice, shake well, and strain into a shot glass or over ice in a small tumbler. It's a strong and creamy drink with a complex flavor profile, thanks to the mix of different spirits and liqueurs."}
