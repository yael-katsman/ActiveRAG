{"question": "ethiopia flight 961 crashes in to the sea", "api_result": "Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, a Boeing 767 aircraft, was hijacked on November 23, 1996, during a flight from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. The hijackers, seeking asylum in Australia, demanded that the plane be flown to Australia despite the pilots explaining that the aircraft did not have enough fuel for such a long journey. Ignoring the warnings, the hijackers forced the pilots to head towards Australia.\n\nEventually, the plane ran out of fuel over the Indian Ocean near the Comoros Islands. The pilots attempted an emergency water landing, but the aircraft broke apart upon hitting the water off the coast of Grande Comore, Comoros. Of the 175 people on board, 123 died, while 52 survived. The crash was captured on video by a tourist, making it one of the few hijackings recorded on video. The incident highlighted the dangers of air piracy and had a significant impact on international aviation security measures."}
