{"question": "who opens the church of the holy sepulchre", "api_result": "The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, a site revered as the place of Christ's crucifixion, burial, and resurrection, is unique in its management and traditions regarding access. The church is shared by multiple Christian denominations, including the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, and Roman Catholic churches, among others. However, the actual opening and closing of the church is traditionally handled by two Muslim families.\n\nThese families, the Nuseibeh and the Joudeh Al-Goudia families, have held the responsibility for centuries. The Joudeh family holds the keys, while the Nuseibeh family is responsible for the physical act of opening and closing the church doors. This arrangement dates back to the times when the Muslim rulers sought to quell disputes among Christian sects over the control of the site by assigning the neutral task of holding the keys to Muslim families. This tradition continues to this day, symbolizing a remarkable example of interfaith respect and cooperation."}
