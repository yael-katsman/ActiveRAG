{"question": "when did the rational dress society begin to work", "api_result": "The Rational Dress Society began its work in the late 19th century, specifically around 1881. This organization was formed in response to the restrictive and often unhealthy women's fashion of the Victorian era, advocating for clothing that allowed greater freedom of movement and was less harmful to women's health. The society promoted simpler and more practical clothing styles, which included advocating for fewer layers and less constrictive garments like corsets."}
