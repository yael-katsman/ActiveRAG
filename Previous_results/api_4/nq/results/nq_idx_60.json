{"question": "who is given credit for the gnu initiative", "api_result": "The GNU Initiative is credited to Richard Stallman, an American computer scientist and activist. He launched the GNU Project in September 1983 with the goal of creating a completely free and open-source Unix-like operating system, which he announced in his famous manifesto published in March 1985. The name \"GNU\" is a recursive acronym for \"GNU's Not Unix.\" This project was foundational in the development of the free software movement, which emphasizes the freedom to use, study, modify, and redistribute software."}
