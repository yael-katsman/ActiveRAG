{"question": "where does the pulmonary trunk receive blood from", "api_result": "The pulmonary trunk receives blood from the right ventricle of the heart. When the right ventricle contracts, it pumps deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary trunk, which then divides into the left and right pulmonary arteries. These arteries carry the blood to the lungs for oxygenation."}
