{"question": "who is the most played artist on spotify", "api_result": "As of my last update in September 2023, the most played artist on Spotify was Bad Bunny. The Puerto Rican artist has been extremely popular on the platform, particularly noted for his album releases and consistent streaming numbers. However, these rankings can change frequently due to new releases and changes in listener preferences, so it's a good idea to check Spotify's current charts or news updates for the most recent information."}
