{"question": "when did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit", "api_result": "The NCAA basketball tournament (March Madness) began to surpass the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in importance and popularity in the mid-20th century. Initially, the NIT, which started in 1938, was considered more prestigious than the NCAA tournament, which began a year later in 1939. However, several factors contributed to the shift in prominence:\n\n1. **Expansion of the NCAA Tournament**: The NCAA tournament gradually expanded its field, allowing more teams from across the country to participate. This expansion helped it gain more national attention.\n\n2. **Television Coverage**: As television became more widespread, the NCAA tournament's national broadcasts helped it reach a broader audience, enhancing its popularity.\n\n3. **Inclusion of Conference Champions**: The NCAA's decision to automatically include conference champions in the tournament field made the NCAA tournament more representative of the entire country and increased its importance to the teams and fans.\n\n4. **Shift in Perception**: Over time, as more top teams chose to participate in the NCAA tournament, it began to be seen as the more prestigious event to determine the national champion.\n\nThe tipping point can be argued to have occurred in the 1970s. By 1975, the NCAA had expanded the tournament to include 32 teams, which significantly broadened its appeal and competitive significance. This era marked a clear shift when the NCAA tournament became the primary national championship event in college basketball, overshadowing the NIT."}
