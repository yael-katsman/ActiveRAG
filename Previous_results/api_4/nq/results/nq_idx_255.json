{"question": "in the early 1800s california society was dominated by which group", "api_result": "In the early 1800s, California society was dominated by the Spanish, who had established missions, presidios (military forts), and pueblos (towns) throughout the region. Following the Spanish, the Californios, descendants of Spanish and Mexican settlers, became the dominant social and political force in California. They owned large ranchos and were influential in the agricultural and political landscape of the area. This dominance continued until the mid-19th century when the influx of settlers during and after the California Gold Rush (beginning in 1848) significantly altered the demographic and social structure of California."}
