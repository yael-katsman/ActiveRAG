{"question": "guardians of the galaxy blue guy in prison", "api_result": "In the movie \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" the blue guy you are referring to is Yondu Udonta. However, Yondu is not the one who is in prison in the film. The main characters who are imprisoned together in the movie are Peter Quill (Star-Lord), Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, Groot, and Drax the Destroyer. They meet and form an alliance while incarcerated in the Kyln, a high-security prison in space. Yondu is actually the leader of the Ravagers, a group of space pirates, and he has a significant role throughout the movie, but he is not one of the characters imprisoned in the Kyln."}
