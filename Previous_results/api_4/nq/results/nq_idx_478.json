{"question": "when did jelly beans became associated with easter", "api_result": "Jelly beans became associated with Easter in the United States around the 1930s. This association likely developed because their egg-like shape made them a natural fit for Easter baskets, which traditionally include eggs as a symbol of new life and rebirth. Jelly beans' bright colors and candy shell also made them popular during springtime celebrations. Over time, they became a staple in Easter festivities, particularly in the form of Easter candy given to children."}
