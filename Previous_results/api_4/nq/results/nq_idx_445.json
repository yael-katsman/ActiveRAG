{"question": "when did new york stop using the electric chair", "api_result": "New York officially stopped using the electric chair as a method of execution in 1963, when the last execution by electric chair was carried out. However, the death penalty itself was effectively abolished in New York in 2007, when the state's highest court ruled that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional. Prior to this, the electric chair had been the standard method of execution in the state since the late 19th century."}
