{"question": "where does the cell spend most of its time in the cell cycle", "api_result": "The cell spends most of its time in the Interphase of the cell cycle. Interphase is the phase where the cell prepares itself for division by growing, increasing the number of organelles, and replicating its DNA. Interphase is further divided into three phases: G1 (Gap 1), S (Synthesis), and G2 (Gap 2). Among these, the G1 phase is typically the longest phase, as the cell grows and performs its normal metabolic functions."}
