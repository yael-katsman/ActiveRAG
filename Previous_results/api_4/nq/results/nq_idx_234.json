{"question": "when did computer become widespread in homes and schools", "api_result": "Computers began to become more widespread in homes and schools during the 1980s and 1990s. The introduction of more user-friendly personal computers such as the Apple II in 1977 and the IBM PC in 1981 played a significant role in this expansion. These devices, along with others like the Commodore 64 (1982) and the Macintosh (1984), became increasingly popular for both educational and personal use.\n\nIn schools, the adoption of computers started to pick up in the early 1980s, with computers being used for teaching programming, word processing, and basic educational games. By the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, as software became more sophisticated and the internet began to emerge, computers became an integral tool in educational settings for a wider range of activities, including research, multimedia projects, and interactive learning.\n\nIn homes, the decrease in the cost of personal computers and the rise of the internet in the 1990s significantly boosted the presence of computers. By the mid to late 1990s, it was increasingly common for households in developed countries to have a personal computer."}
