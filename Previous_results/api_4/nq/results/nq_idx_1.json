{"question": "where is geothermal energy used the most in the us", "api_result": "As of my last update in 2023, the United States is one of the world's largest producers of geothermal energy, and the majority of its geothermal power plants are located in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. California is the leading state in terms of geothermal energy production. The largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at The Geysers, a geothermal field in California. Nevada also has significant geothermal energy production, with numerous plants across the state. Other states with notable geothermal activity include Utah, Oregon, and Idaho. These areas have high geothermal potential due to their geological features, including tectonic plate boundaries and volcanic activity, which provide the heat needed to produce geothermal energy."}
