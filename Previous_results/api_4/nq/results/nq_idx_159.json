{"question": "what is the snow on mars made of", "api_result": "On Mars, snow can be composed of two primary substances: water ice and carbon dioxide ice (commonly known as \"dry ice\"). The type of snow depends on the location and the season on Mars.\n\n1. **Water Ice Snow**: Similar to Earth, Mars has water ice clouds from which snow can fall. This type of snow has been observed by missions such as the Phoenix Mars Lander, which in 2008 detected water-ice snow falling from clouds about 4 kilometers above its landing site near the Martian north pole.\n\n2. **Carbon Dioxide Snow**: Mars also experiences snow made of carbon dioxide. This occurs primarily in the polar regions, particularly during the Martian winter when temperatures drop significantly, allowing carbon dioxide to freeze out of the atmosphere. This was confirmed by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which detected carbon dioxide snow clouds and even snowfall occurring near the south pole of Mars.\n\nBoth types of snow on Mars contribute to the seasonal ice caps that grow and recede with the changing Martian seasons."}
