{"question": "when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario", "api_result": "Aluminum wiring was commonly used in residential properties across North America, including Ontario, during the 1960s and early 1970s. This was primarily due to the high cost of copper at the time. However, by the mid-1970s, the use of aluminum wiring in residential construction significantly decreased due to increasing awareness of the potential fire hazards associated with improper connections and the physical properties of aluminum.\n\nIn Ontario, as in many other jurisdictions, the use of aluminum wiring has not been entirely banned, but there are strict regulations and codes that govern its use to ensure safety. The Ontario Electrical Safety Code, which is updated periodically, includes specific requirements for the installation of aluminum wiring if it is used. These include using appropriate connectors, ensuring proper installation techniques, and sometimes requiring inspections or upgrades by a licensed electrician.\n\nFor new residential construction, copper wiring is predominantly used today due to its durability and lower risk factors. However, aluminum wiring may still be found in older homes or in certain applications where it is deemed safe and appropriate under current codes and standards. If you have a home with existing aluminum wiring, it is recommended to have it inspected and possibly upgraded by a qualified professional to ensure it meets current safety standards."}
