{"question": "how many co2 molecules are produced in aerobic respiration", "api_result": "In aerobic respiration, glucose (C6H12O6) is broken down into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) using oxygen (O2). The overall chemical equation for aerobic respiration is:\n\n\\[ C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \\rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy \\]\n\nFrom this equation, it is clear that each molecule of glucose metabolized results in the production of six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2). This process occurs in the mitochondria of cells and is fundamental for energy production in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate)."}
