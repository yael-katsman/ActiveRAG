{"question": "when do you pray the chaplet of divine mercy", "api_result": "The Chaplet of Divine Mercy is traditionally prayed using rosary beads and can be recited at any time, but it is especially associated with the 3 o'clock hour, which is considered the hour of great mercy. According to Saint Faustina Kowalska, who promoted the devotion following her reported visions of Jesus, Christ told her that this hour commemorates His death on the cross, and it is a time when mercy triumphed over justice. Therefore, praying the Chaplet at this hour is particularly powerful and significant.\n\nMany people also pray the Chaplet during the Divine Mercy Novena, which starts on Good Friday and ends on the Saturday before Divine Mercy Sunday (the Sunday after Easter). However, the Chaplet can be prayed daily or as often as one wishes to implore God's mercy."}
