{"question": "who makes the important government decisions in an autocracy", "api_result": "In an autocracy, the important government decisions are made by a single individual who holds supreme power. This individual could be a dictator, a monarch, or an autocratic leader who exercises control without being restricted by democratic processes or other forms of political pluralism. The leader typically has centralized authority and may make decisions with little or no input from other branches of government, political parties, or the general public."}
