{"question": "when was fingerprinting first used by the police", "api_result": "Fingerprinting was first used by the police in the late 19th century. The first systematic use of fingerprints in police work was by Sir William James Herschel of the Indian Civil Service, who began using fingerprints in 1858 to prevent fraud in Bengal, India. However, it was not until 1892 that fingerprints were used as a method for identifying criminals by police in Argentina, thanks to the efforts of Juan Vucetich, an Argentine police official who developed his own system of classification. In 1901, fingerprinting was introduced to England and Wales by Sir Edward Richard Henry, whose system of classification (the Henry Classification System) became widely used in the English-speaking world."}
