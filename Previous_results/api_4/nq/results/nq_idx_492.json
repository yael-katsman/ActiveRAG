{"question": "which layer of the osi model handles physical addressing", "api_result": "In the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, physical addressing is handled by the Data Link layer. This is the second layer of the OSI model. The Data Link layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer between two directly connected nodes. It also handles error correction from the physical layer, flow control, and frame synchronization. The physical address, often referred to as the MAC (Media Access Control) address, is used at this layer to ensure that data is delivered to the correct device on a local network."}
