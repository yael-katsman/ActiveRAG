{"question": "who is the guy that jumped from space", "api_result": "The man who famously jumped from the edge of space is Felix Baumgartner. He made this record-breaking skydive on October 14, 2012, as part of the Red Bull Stratos project. Baumgartner jumped from a helium balloon that was approximately 128,100 feet (about 39 kilometers) above the Earth. This jump set records for the highest manned balloon flight, the highest altitude jump, and the fastest freefall, during which he reached a speed of 843.6 mph (1,357.6 km/h), breaking the sound barrier."}
