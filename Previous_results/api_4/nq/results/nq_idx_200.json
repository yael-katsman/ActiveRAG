{"question": "what does it mean to fuse the spine", "api_result": "Spinal fusion is a surgical procedure used to correct problems with the small bones in the spine (vertebrae). It is essentially a \"welding\" process. The basic idea is to fuse together the painful vertebrae so that they heal into a single, solid bone. \n\nSpinal fusion is used to treat several conditions, including:\n\n1. **Degenerative Disk Disease**: The cushioning disks between the vertebrae break down, which can lead to pain, instability, and other symptoms.\n2. **Spinal Stenosis**: Narrowing of the spinal canal that causes nerve pain.\n3. **Scoliosis**: An abnormal curvature of the spine.\n4. **Spondylolisthesis**: A condition in which one vertebra slips forward over another.\n5. **Fracture**: Broken spinal bones.\n6. **Infection or Tumor**: When a spinal tumor or infection damages the vertebrae.\n\nThe surgery involves techniques designed to mimic the normal healing process of broken bones. During the surgery, the surgeon places bone or a bonelike material within the space between two spinal vertebrae. Metal plates, screws, and rods may be used to hold the vertebrae together, so they can heal into one solid unit.\n\nThe goal of the surgery is to restore spinal stability and alignment and reduce pain. However, it does come with risks such as infection, nerve damage, and blood clots, and the recovery can be lengthy, often requiring physical therapy. Additionally, spinal fusion can lead to some loss of flexibility in the spine, depending on how many vertebrae are fused."}
