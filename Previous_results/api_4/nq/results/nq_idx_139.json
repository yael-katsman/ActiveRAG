{"question": "what is the form of mozart symphony no 40", "api_result": "Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550, is one of his most famous and frequently performed symphonies. It is structured in the classical symphonic form, consisting of four movements:\n\n1. **Molto allegro**: The first movement is in sonata form, which includes an exposition, development, and recapitulation. This movement is known for its dramatic and urgent opening theme.\n\n2. **Andante**: The second movement is also in sonata form but has a slower, more lyrical pace compared to the first movement. It provides a contrast with its smoother and more melodic lines.\n\n3. **Menuetto: Allegretto**: The third movement is a minuet and trio, a common form in classical symphonies. This movement provides a stately and somewhat somber dance-like character.\n\n4. **Allegro assai**: The final movement is in sonata form as well, and it is vigorous and fast-paced, bringing the symphony to a powerful and energetic conclusion.\n\nThis symphony is notable for its emotional depth and intricate musical structure, characteristic of Mozart's late symphonic works."}
