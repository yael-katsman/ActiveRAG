{"question": "where in the bible can i find the lord's prayer", "api_result": "The Lord's Prayer, also known as the Our Father, can be found in two places in the New Testament of the Bible:\n\n1. **Matthew 6:9-13** - This version is part of the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus teaches this prayer to His disciples as a way of praying.\n2. **Luke 11:2-4** - This version is slightly shorter and is given in response to a disciple's request, \"Lord, teach us to pray.\"\n\nBoth versions offer a model of how to pray, focusing on acknowledging God's holiness, asking for His kingdom to come, requesting daily needs, seeking forgiveness, and asking for deliverance from temptation."}
