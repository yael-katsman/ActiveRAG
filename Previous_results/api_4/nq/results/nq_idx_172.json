{"question": "where is arachidonic acid found in the body", "api_result": "Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid that plays a crucial role in the body. It is primarily found in the phospholipids of cell membranes throughout the body. This fatty acid is particularly abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. Additionally, arachidonic acid is a key inflammatory intermediate, which can be converted into various eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, which are involved in processes such as inflammation and immune responses.\n\nDietary sources of arachidonic acid include meat, eggs, and some fish, which can contribute to its levels in the body. However, it can also be synthesized endogenously from linoleic acid, which is found in vegetable oils and other plant-based foods."}
