{"question": "where does the president get authority to issue executive orders", "api_result": "The President of the United States derives the authority to issue executive orders from the U.S. Constitution, although the Constitution does not explicitly mention executive orders. The primary sources of this authority are:\n\n1. **Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution**: This section vests the executive power in the President. It states, \"The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\" This broad grant of executive powers is generally interpreted to include the issuance of executive orders as a means to manage the operations of the federal government.\n\n2. **Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution**: This section requires the President to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" This clause, known as the Take Care Clause, is often used to justify the issuance of executive orders, particularly those that direct the manner in which laws or regulations should be implemented or enforced by federal agencies.\n\nExecutive orders are a means for the President to manage and operate the federal government. They can direct government agencies, clarify and further existing laws, set policy, and manage the federal administrative machinery. Executive orders are subject to judicial review and can be overturned if found to be unconstitutional or not supported by statute. Additionally, Congress can pass legislation that can override executive orders, although such legislation would require passage by both houses of Congress and either presidential approval or a veto override."}
