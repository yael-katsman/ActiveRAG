{"question": "who is the father of lucius in gladiator", "api_result": "In the movie \"Gladiator\" (2000), directed by Ridley Scott, Lucius Verus is the young son of Lucilla. Lucilla is the sister of Commodus, the antagonist of the film. Lucius's father is not a character in the movie, and his background is not extensively discussed. However, historically, Lucilla was married to Lucius Verus, who was co-emperor with Marcus Aurelius, making him the historical father of Lucius Verus the younger. In the context of the film, it is implied that Lucius's father is either Lucius Verus or another unnamed character, as the film does not specify and takes creative liberties with historical accuracy."}
