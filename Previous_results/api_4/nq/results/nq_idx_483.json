{"question": "what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body", "api_result": "The two main extracellular fluid compartments in the human body are:\n\n1. **Interstitial Fluid**: This is the fluid that surrounds and bathes the cells. It fills the spaces between cells in tissues and is a major component of the extracellular fluid. Interstitial fluid provides the immediate microenvironment that allows for movement of ions, proteins, and nutrients across the cell membrane.\n\n2. **Plasma**: This is the liquid component of blood, in which the blood cells are suspended. Plasma makes up about 55% of the total blood volume and contains water, salts, enzymes, antibodies, and other proteins. It plays a critical role in transporting nutrients, hormones, and proteins to various parts of the body and in removing waste products.\n\nTogether, these compartments facilitate the transport of substances to and from cells, helping to maintain homeostasis within the body."}
