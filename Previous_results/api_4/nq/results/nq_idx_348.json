{"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "api_result": "In the United States, whether someone is considered under the poverty line is determined by the poverty thresholds set by the U.S. Census Bureau. These thresholds vary by family size and composition. For instance, in 2021, the poverty threshold for a single individual under 65 was approximately $13,590, while for a family of four (two adults and two children), it was about $26,500.\n\nHowever, the definition and thresholds of poverty can differ significantly in other countries and regions, often based on local economic conditions and government standards. International organizations like the World Bank also use different measures, such as the international poverty line, which is commonly set at $1.90 per day (in 2011 purchasing power parity terms) to define extreme poverty globally.\n\nIt's important to note that these figures are periodically updated to reflect changes in economic conditions, cost of living, and other factors."}
