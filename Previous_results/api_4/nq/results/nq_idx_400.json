{"question": "where does the sciatic nerve run in the foot", "api_result": "The sciatic nerve itself does not run into the foot. It is a large nerve that originates in the lower back and runs through the buttocks and down the legs. However, the sciatic nerve branches into other nerves that continue into the foot.\n\nHere's how the nerve pathway extends:\n\n1. **Sciatic Nerve**: Starts from the lower spine (L4 to S3 spinal nerves), runs through the buttocks, and down each leg.\n\n2. **Divides into Two Major Branches**: At around the knee, the sciatic nerve typically divides into the tibial nerve and the common fibular (peroneal) nerve.\n\n3. **Tibial Nerve**: Continues down the back of the leg and into the foot. It further divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves, which innervate most of the bottom of the foot.\n\n4. **Common Fibular (Peroneal) Nerve**: Wraps around the fibula (a bone in the lower leg) and divides into the superficial fibular nerve and the deep fibular nerve. The superficial fibular nerve innervates the outer part of the lower leg and the top of the foot, while the deep fibular nerve runs to the area between the first and second toes.\n\nThus, while the sciatic nerve itself does not run into the foot, its branches (particularly the tibial nerve and its further subdivisions, the medial and lateral plantar nerves) are responsible for sensory and motor functions in the foot."}
