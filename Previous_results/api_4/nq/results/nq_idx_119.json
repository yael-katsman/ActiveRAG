{"question": "when did sussex split into east and west", "api_result": "Sussex, historically a county in South East England, was divided into East Sussex and West Sussex for administrative purposes in 1888. This division was formalized under the Local Government Act of 1888, which established county councils in England and Wales. Prior to this, Sussex was a single administrative area, although it had been informally recognized as having eastern and western parts based on cultural and geographical differences. The formal split in 1888 created two separate administrative counties, each with its own county council."}
