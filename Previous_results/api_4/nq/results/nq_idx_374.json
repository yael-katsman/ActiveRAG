{"question": "when did the nba start playing zone defense", "api_result": "The NBA officially allowed zone defense starting in the 2001-2002 season. Prior to this change, the league had rules that were more restrictive, primarily enforcing man-to-man defense, with limitations that effectively banned zone defense. The rule change was part of an effort to increase movement and scoring opportunities, as well as to provide teams with more strategic options on defense."}
