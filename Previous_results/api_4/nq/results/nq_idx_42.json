{"question": "where was the film the remains of the day filmed", "api_result": "The film \"The Remains of the Day\" was primarily filmed in the United Kingdom. One of the most notable filming locations was Dyrham Park in South Gloucestershire, England, which was used to represent the fictional Darlington Hall. Other locations in England, such as Powderham Castle in Devon, Corsham Court in Wiltshire, and Badminton House in Gloucestershire, were also used to shoot various scenes in the film. These historic estates and manor houses provided the perfect backdrop for the story, set in a grand English house between the wars."}
