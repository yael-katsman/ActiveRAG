{"question": "what is the highest base on the ph scale", "api_result": "The pH scale is used to measure how acidic or basic (alkaline) a solution is. The scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH less than 7 indicates acidity, while a pH greater than 7 indicates alkalinity.\n\nThe highest base on the pH scale would be a substance with a pH of 14, which is the most basic or alkaline value on the scale. Examples of substances with a very high pH near 14 include concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH). These are strong bases and are highly caustic, meaning they can cause severe chemical burns and are dangerous to handle without proper safety precautions."}
