{"question": "who is stephanie's mom on the bold and the beautiful", "api_result": "As of my last update, Stephanie Forrester's mother on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" is Ann Douglas. Ann Douglas was portrayed by actress Betty White. Stephanie, a central character on the show for many years, was played by Susan Flannery. Ann's character was introduced later in the series and her relationship with Stephanie was depicted as complex and strained, largely due to Ann's past decisions and their impact on Stephanie and her sister, Pamela Douglas."}
