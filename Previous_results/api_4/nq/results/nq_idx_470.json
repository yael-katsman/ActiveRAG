{"question": "what is loihi and where does it originate from", "api_result": "Loihi is an active submarine volcano located in the Pacific Ocean, southeast of the island of Hawaii. It is part of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, which is formed by the movement of the Pacific tectonic plate over a geological hotspot\u2014a region where hot magma rises from deep within the Earth to the surface. Loihi represents the newest volcano in this chain, and it is currently in the process of forming a new island that will eventually rise above the ocean's surface, although this is likely to take tens of thousands of years. The volcano originates from the same hotspot that has formed the existing Hawaiian Islands."}
