{"question": "where was the original planet of the apes filmed at", "api_result": "The original \"Planet of the Apes\" film, released in 1968, was primarily filmed in various locations in the United States. Key filming locations included:\n\n1. **Malibu Creek State Park, California** - This park served as the backdrop for many of the outdoor scenes on the ape planet. The rugged terrain and natural landscapes provided an otherworldly feel that was crucial for the setting of the film.\n\n2. **Lake Powell, Arizona/Utah** - The scenes involving the astronauts' initial arrival and their discovery of a desolate landscape were shot here. The lake's shoreline and surrounding desert offered a stark, alien environment that effectively represented an Earth-like planet altered by apocalyptic events.\n\n3. **Fox Movie Ranch (now Malibu Creek State Park), California** - Some of the scenes set in the Ape City were filmed here. The ranch provided a controlled environment for the construction of the ape structures and facilitated easier logistics for the production team.\n\n4. **Westward Beach, Point Dume, Malibu, California** - The iconic final scene of the film, where Charlton Heston's character, George Taylor, discovers the remains of the Statue of Liberty, was filmed here. This dramatic revelation occurs on a beach, which was effectively portrayed by this location.\n\nThese locations helped create the distinctive and memorable settings that contributed to the film's impact and enduring popularity."}
