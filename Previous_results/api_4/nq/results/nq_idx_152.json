{"question": "where does the sun hit the us first", "api_result": "The first place in the United States where the sun rises is Point Udall on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. This easternmost point of the United States receives the first sunrise. In terms of the contiguous United States, the easternmost point is West Quoddy Head, Maine, which is among the first places to see the sunrise. However, due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit, the exact location where the sun first rises can change throughout the year."}
