{"question": "who laid the foundation of school of possibilism", "api_result": "The foundation of the school of possibilism in geography is primarily attributed to the French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache. Possibilism is a theory that emerged as a response to environmental determinism, which emphasized that the physical environment, particularly the climate, determines the patterns of human culture and societal development. \n\nVidal de la Blache argued against this deterministic view, proposing instead that while the environment sets certain constraints or offers opportunities, it is the culture of a society that determines how the environment is used. In his view, human beings are not merely passive recipients of environmental constraints but are active agents who have the capability of choosing from a range of possibilities in their environment. This theory highlighted human agency, cultural variability, and the potential for multiple outcomes in human-environment interactions, which was a significant shift from the deterministic approach."}
