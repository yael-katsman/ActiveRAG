{"question": "where is the tablet of the ten commandments", "api_result": "The location of the original tablets of the Ten Commandments, as described in the Bible, is not definitively known today. According to biblical tradition, the tablets were stored in the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark, according to the Old Testament, was a sacred chest built by the Israelites under the guidance of Moses, which housed the tablets.\n\nThe last known location of the Ark of the Covenant, according to the Bible, was in the Temple in Jerusalem. However, it disappeared from historical records after the Babylonians sacked Jerusalem in 587 BCE. There are various theories and claims about the fate of the Ark and the tablets it contained, but none have been confirmed by historical or archaeological evidence.\n\nOne popular claim is that the Ark is in Ethiopia, specifically at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims that the Ark has been kept there for centuries, guarded by a select group of monks who are the only ones allowed to see it. However, this claim has not been verified, as the monks do not allow outsiders to view the Ark.\n\nThus, the exact location of the original tablets of the Ten Commandments remains a subject of speculation and religious belief."}
