{"question": "who sings stop listen what's that sound", "api_result": "The lyric \"Stop, hey, what's that sound?\" comes from the song \"For What It's Worth\" by Buffalo Springfield. The song was written by Stephen Stills and released in 1966. It became one of the most recognizable protest songs of the 1960s, often associated with the counterculture movement and protests against the Vietnam War, although it was originally inspired by local tensions over a curfew in Los Angeles."}
