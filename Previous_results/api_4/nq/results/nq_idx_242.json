{"question": "what is the name of the first earthquake early warning system", "api_result": "The first earthquake early warning system is generally considered to be the one developed in Japan, known as the \"Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Earthquake Early Warning System.\" This system, which began operation in 2007, is designed to alert people seconds to minutes before an earthquake hits, allowing them time to take protective actions. Japan's system utilizes a network of seismometers across the country to detect initial seismic waves (P-waves) and quickly estimate the location and magnitude of an earthquake, issuing warnings if it is determined to be a threat."}
