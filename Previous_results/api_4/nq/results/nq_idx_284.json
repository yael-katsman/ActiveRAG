{"question": "who made the nuclear model of an atom", "api_result": "The nuclear model of the atom, also known as the Rutherford model, was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. This model came about after Rutherford's famous gold foil experiment, which he conducted along with his assistants Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden. In this experiment, they directed alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil and observed the patterns of scattering. The results led Rutherford to conclude that the atom consists of a small, dense nucleus containing most of the atom's mass and carrying a positive charge, with electrons orbiting around the nucleus at a relatively large distance. This model marked a significant shift from the earlier plum pudding model proposed by J.J. Thomson, which depicted the atom as a sphere of positive charge with electrons embedded within it."}
