{"question": "what does the adrenal gland produce that is necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function", "api_result": "The adrenal gland, specifically the adrenal medulla (the inner part of the adrenal gland), produces catecholamines, primarily adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine), which are necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function. These hormones are released into the bloodstream and act as neurotransmitters to help mediate the body's response to stress or danger, commonly known as the \"fight or flight\" response. This response includes increasing heart rate, elevating blood pressure, and boosting energy supplies, among other effects, which are crucial for the sympathetic nervous system's activation and function."}
