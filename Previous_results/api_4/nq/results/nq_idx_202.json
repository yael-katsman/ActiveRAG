{"question": "is jaffa cakes a biscuit or a cake", "api_result": "Jaffa Cakes are classified as cakes, not biscuits. This classification was famously confirmed in a UK court ruling in 1991, where McVities, the manufacturer of Jaffa Cakes, successfully argued that Jaffa Cakes should be considered cakes for tax purposes. The distinction was crucial because, under UK tax law, cakes are zero-rated and do not attract VAT (Value Added Tax), whereas chocolate-covered biscuits do.\n\nThe court's decision was based on characteristics such as the ingredients, size, texture, and how the product hardens over time (cakes tend to harden while biscuits go soft). Jaffa Cakes have a sponge cake base, which hardens as it goes stale, aligning more with the characteristics of cakes rather than biscuits."}
