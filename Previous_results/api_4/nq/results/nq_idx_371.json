{"question": "how long do former presidents get secret service protection", "api_result": "As of the latest information available up to 2023, former U.S. presidents receive Secret Service protection for their lifetime. This policy was reinstated in 2013 by the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012, which reversed a 1994 law that had limited Secret Service protection for former presidents to 10 years after leaving office. The spouses of former presidents also receive lifetime protection, unless they remarry. Additionally, their children receive protection until they are 16 years old."}
