{"question": "how many games in a row have the uconn women's basketball team won", "api_result": "As of my last update in January 2023, I don't have the current streak for the UConn women's basketball team. However, they hold the record for the longest winning streak in NCAA basketball history (men's or women's) with 111 consecutive wins from 2014 to 2017. For the most current information on their current winning streak, I recommend checking the latest sports news or the UConn women's basketball official website."}
