{"question": "the creation of human beings in the kumulipo happens during which w\u0101 or period of creation", "api_result": "In the Kumulipo, the ancient Hawaiian chant of creation, the creation of human beings occurs in the twelfth w\u0101, or period of creation. The Kumulipo is structured into sixteen w\u0101, each representing different phases or epochs of creation, starting from the simplest forms of life and progressively leading up to more complex beings. The twelfth w\u0101 specifically marks the appearance of the first human, La\u02bbila\u02bbi, who is female, and later the first male, Ki\u02bbi. This period signifies the transition from the creation of various life forms to the establishment of human life, which plays a central role in the continuation of the chant and the genealogical accounts that follow."}
