{"question": "Where certain religions divide the notion of heaven into parts there are generally?", "api_result": "In various religious traditions, the concept of heaven is often divided into different levels or parts. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Christianity**: In some Christian denominations, particularly in Catholicism, heaven is sometimes seen as having different levels of closeness to God. The most detailed description comes from Dante's \"Divine Comedy,\" where heaven is depicted as having nine levels or spheres, each representing closer communion with God. However, it's important to note that this is more a literary and allegorical depiction than a formal theological doctrine.\n\n2. **Islam**: In Islamic belief, heaven (Jannah) is typically described as having multiple levels, with the number of levels often stated as seven. Each level is for those who have varying degrees of righteousness, with the highest levels reserved for the most devout and righteous believers.\n\n3. **Judaism**: In Jewish eschatology, there are often references to different levels of heaven. The Talmud mentions seven heavens, and Kabbalistic texts refer to four or five worlds, each corresponding to different levels of spiritual purity.\n\n4. **Hinduism**: In Hindu cosmology, there are several heavens, each corresponding to different levels of existence and different deities. These are not permanent places for the soul but stages through which it passes in its cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.\n\n5. **Buddhism**: In Buddhist cosmology, there are multiple heavens within the broader framework of the Six Realms of Rebirth. These heavenly realms are places where beings are reborn due to good karma but are still part of the cycle of samsara (rebirth) and not ultimate destinations.\n\nThese divisions reflect the belief that spiritual attainment or closeness to the divine can vary among individuals, and thus, different levels of heaven represent different stages of spiritual achievement or closeness to God."}
