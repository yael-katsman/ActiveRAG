{"question": "What was the name of Sir Fred Hoyles theory, an alternative to the Big Bang, that said that there was continuous creation of matter between galaxies, so that as galaxies get further apart, new ones develop between them?", "api_result": "The theory proposed by Sir Fred Hoyle that serves as an alternative to the Big Bang theory is called the \"Steady State theory.\" This theory suggests that the universe is in a constant state of expansion, but maintains a consistent average density, due to continuous creation of matter. This creation of new matter is hypothesized to occur primarily in the spaces between galaxies, allowing for the formation of new galaxies as older ones move apart."}
