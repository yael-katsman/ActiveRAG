{"question": "What the note is at the 12th fret of the 1st and 6th strings of a standard-tuned 6-string guitar?", "api_result": "In standard tuning on a 6-string guitar, both the 1st string (high E) and the 6th string (low E) are tuned to the note E. When you play the 12th fret on any string of a guitar, it produces a note that is one octave higher than the open string. Therefore, the note at the 12th fret of both the 1st and 6th strings in standard tuning is E, one octave higher than the open E strings."}
