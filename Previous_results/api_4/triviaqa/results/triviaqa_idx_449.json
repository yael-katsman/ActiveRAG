{"question": "Which Football League club play their home games at Kingsmeadow, also known as the Cherry Red Records Stadium?", "api_result": "As of my last update, AFC Wimbledon played their home games at Kingsmeadow, also known as the Cherry Red Records Stadium. However, it's important to note that AFC Wimbledon moved to a new stadium, Plough Lane, in November 2020. Therefore, Kingsmeadow is now primarily used by Chelsea Women and Chelsea FC's youth teams."}
