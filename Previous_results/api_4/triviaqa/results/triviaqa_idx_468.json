{"question": "What are the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron known as?", "api_result": "The tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron are known as the Platonic solids. These are convex polyhedra with identical faces composed of congruent convex regular polygons and the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. They are named after the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, who theorized that the classical elements were constructed from these regular solids."}
