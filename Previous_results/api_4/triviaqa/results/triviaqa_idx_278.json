{"question": "Who were the notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe?", "api_result": "The notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe, also known as the Hellfire Club, were a group of high-society individuals in the 18th century, primarily known for their debauched gatherings, where they engaged in activities that were considered scandalous at the time. The group was founded by Sir Francis Dashwood in the mid-1700s and included various influential members of British society, including politicians, noblemen, and other prominent figures.\n\nThe Hellfire Club members met at Medmenham Abbey, on the banks of the River Thames, and later in the caves of West Wycombe. Their activities reportedly included mock religious ceremonies, feasting, drinking, and the inclusion of prostitutes dressed as nuns. The club's motto was \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" (Do what thou wilt), a philosophy of living that flouted the conservative and religious norms of the period.\n\nThe group's activities have been the subject of much speculation and sensationalism, contributing to their enduring notoriety in British history. The Hellfire Club's legacy continues to fascinate historians and the public alike, often being cited as an example of the decadence of the British upper classes in the 18th century."}
