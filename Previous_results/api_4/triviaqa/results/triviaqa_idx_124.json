{"question": "Approximately how many years old is the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef?", "api_result": "The living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef is approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years old. This age estimate is based on the current living coral structure, which has grown on top of older, dead coral structures that date back much further, possibly as much as 20 million years. The growth of the current living reef structure began after the last ice age when sea levels rose and conditions became suitable for coral growth."}
