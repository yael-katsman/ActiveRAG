{"question": "Saratoga and Yorktown, USA, are the sites of the defeat of which armies?", "api_result": "Saratoga and Yorktown are significant sites in American history as they were the locations of major defeats of British armies during the American Revolutionary War.\n\n1. **Saratoga**: The Battles of Saratoga, which occurred in 1777 in upstate New York, marked a turning point in the Revolutionary War. The British army, led by General John Burgoyne, was defeated by American forces under the command of General Horatio Gates. This victory was pivotal as it boosted American morale and helped secure French support for the American cause.\n\n2. **Yorktown**: The Siege of Yorktown in 1781 in Virginia was another critical defeat for the British. General Charles Cornwallis's army was besieged by American forces led by General George Washington and French troops under the command of General Comte de Rochambeau. The surrender of Cornwallis's army at Yorktown effectively ended major military operations in the American Revolution and led to the negotiation of peace terms."}
