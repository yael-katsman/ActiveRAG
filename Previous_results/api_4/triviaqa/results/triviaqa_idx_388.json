{"question": "Who coined the term Rock and Roll?", "api_result": "The term \"rock and roll\" was popularized by disc jockey Alan Freed in the early 1950s. Freed used the term to describe the mix of rhythm and blues, gospel, and country music he played on his radio show, which appealed to a diverse, young audience. The term itself, however, has older origins, often appearing in the lyrics of R&B songs in the 1930s and 1940s, where it was typically used as a euphemism for dancing or sex. Alan Freed is credited with transforming the term into a label for a new genre of music that became a cultural phenomenon."}
