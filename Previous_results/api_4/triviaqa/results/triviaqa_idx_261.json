{"question": "Who first identified and isolated nucleic acids, the precursor to identifying DNA?", "api_result": "Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss biochemist, was the first to identify and isolate nucleic acids in 1869. He discovered a substance in the nuclei of white blood cells, which he called \"nuclein,\" later known as nucleic acid, the precursor to DNA. This discovery was crucial in the eventual identification and understanding of DNA as the carrier of genetic information."}
