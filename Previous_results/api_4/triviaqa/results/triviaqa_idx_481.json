{"question": "When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?", "api_result": "When the egg is released from the ovary during ovulation, the structure that remains is called the corpus luteum. This is formed from the follicle that previously housed the egg. The corpus luteum is crucial as it produces hormones, predominantly progesterone, and some estrogen, which are essential for maintaining the lining of the uterus and supporting early pregnancy if fertilization occurs. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates and hormone levels drop, leading to the shedding of the uterine lining during menstruation."}
