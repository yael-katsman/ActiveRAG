{"question": "Who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War?", "api_result": "Salvador Dal\u00ed was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War. His ambiguous position towards the conflict and refusal to explicitly denounce fascism led to tensions with other members of the Surrealist group, who were predominantly aligned with leftist and anti-fascist politics. This ideological conflict ultimately led to his expulsion from the movement."}
