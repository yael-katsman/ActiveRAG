What is MMORPG?", "api_result": "MMORPG stands for \"Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game.\" It is a genre of video games that combines aspects of role-playing video games with the gameplay of massively multiplayer online games. In MMORPGs, a large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world. As in role-playing games (RPGs), players assume the roles of characters and take control over many of those characters' actions. MMORPGs often feature vast open worlds, complex narratives, and extensive character development systems. Players can cooperate or compete with each other on a large scale, and their interactions form a significant aspect of the game's appeal and longevity."}
