{"question": "Which war, engineered by Bismarck, included the siege and surrender of Paris and ended in the union of German states with William I as emperor?", "api_result": "The war you are referring to is the Franco-Prussian War, which occurred from 1870 to 1871. This conflict was indeed engineered by Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Prussia, as part of his plan to unify the various German states under Prussian leadership. The war included the significant Siege of Paris, which lasted from September 1870 to January 1871, ultimately leading to the surrender of Paris. The war concluded with the Treaty of Frankfurt in May 1871, and the unification of the German states was solidified with the proclamation of William I as the German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles on January 18, 1871."}
