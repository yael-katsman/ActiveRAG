{"question": "Which international treaties of 1899 and 1907 cover the use of weapons in war?", "api_result": "The international treaties that cover the use of weapons in war from 1899 and 1907 are the Hague Conventions. These conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law. The conventions were held in 1899 and 1907, respectively, and were primarily concerned with the codification of rules of warfare and the limitation of certain types of modern weaponry. Specifically, they addressed issues such as the launching of projectiles and explosives from balloons, the use of poison or poisoned weapons, and the rights and duties of neutral powers in case of war on land."}
