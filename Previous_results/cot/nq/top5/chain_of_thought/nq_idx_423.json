{"question": "where does prime rib come from on a cow", "chain_of_thought_result": "Prime rib comes from the rib section of a cow. Specifically, it is cut from the primal rib area, which is located between the chuck (shoulder) and the loin (back) sections of the animal. This area includes ribs six through twelve and is known for its tenderness and rich flavor due to the marbling of fat within the meat.
