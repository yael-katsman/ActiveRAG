{"question": "when did the first ice age come out", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question about when the first ice age occurred, we need to clarify what is meant by \"the first ice age.\" \n\n1. **Understanding Ice Ages**: Ice ages are periods in Earth's history characterized by significant drops in temperature, leading to the expansion of continental ice sheets and glaciers. \n\n2. **The First Ice Age**: The first major ice age is known as the Huronian Ice Age, which occurred approximately 2.4 billion to 2.1 billion years ago. This ice age is believed to have been triggered by a decrease in greenhouse gases, particularly methane, due to the emergence of photosynthetic organisms.\n\n3. **Subsequent Ice Ages**: There have been several other ice ages throughout Earth's history, including the Cryogenian Ice Age (around 720 to 635 million years ago) and the more recent Pleistocene Ice Age, which began about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, if we refer to the first significant ice age in geological history, it would be the Huronian Ice Age, occurring around 2.4 billion years ago.\n\nAnswer: The first major ice age, known as the Huronian Ice Age, occurred approximately 2.4 billion to 2.1 billion years ago."}
