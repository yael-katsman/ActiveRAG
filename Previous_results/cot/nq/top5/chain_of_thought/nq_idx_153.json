{"question": "is parallax more pronounced with nearby stars or with distant stars", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine whether parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars or with distant stars, let's break down the concept of parallax:\n\n1. **Definition of Parallax**: Parallax is the apparent shift in position of an object when viewed from different angles. In astronomy, it refers to the apparent movement of a star against the background of more distant stars as the Earth orbits the Sun.\n\n2. **Measurement of Parallax**: The parallax angle is measured in arcseconds and is defined as half the angle of the apparent shift observed over a baseline of 1 astronomical unit (the average distance from the Earth to the Sun).\n\n3. **Distance and Parallax Relationship**: The closer an object is, the larger the parallax angle will be. This is because the baseline (the distance between two observation points) remains constant, but the angle of apparent shift increases as the object gets closer.\n\n4. **Distant Stars**: For stars that are far away, the parallax angle becomes very small, often less than a fraction of an arcsecond. This makes it difficult to measure their parallax accurately.\n\n5. **Nearby Stars**: In contrast, nearby stars exhibit a more significant parallax shift, making it easier to measure their distances using this method.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since parallax is more pronounced with objects that are closer, we can conclude that parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars than with distant stars.\n\nAnswer: Parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars."}
