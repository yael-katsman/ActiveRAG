{"question": "what states do not allow daylight savings time", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine which states do not observe Daylight Saving Time (DST), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Daylight Saving Time**: Daylight Saving Time involves setting the clock forward by one hour during warmer months to extend evening daylight. It typically starts in the spring and ends in the fall.\n\n2. **Identify States That Do Not Observe DST**: \n   - **Arizona**: The majority of Arizona does not observe DST, with the exception of the Navajo Nation, which does.\n   - **Hawaii**: Hawaii does not observe DST at all.\n\n3. **Check for Exceptions**: Some territories and regions may also not observe DST, but the question specifically asks about states.\n\n4. **Confirm Current Regulations**: As of the latest information, only Arizona and Hawaii are the two states that do not observe Daylight Saving Time.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The states that do not allow Daylight Saving Time are:\n   - Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation)\n   - Hawaii\n\nSo, the final answer is: **Arizona and Hawaii**."}
