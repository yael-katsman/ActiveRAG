{"question": "name two fibres which are made of proteins", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question about two fibers made of proteins, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Fibers**: Fibers can be natural or synthetic, and they can be made from various materials, including proteins.\n\n2. **Identifying Protein Fibers**: Protein fibers are derived from animal sources and are primarily composed of proteins like keratin or fibroin.\n\n3. **Examples of Protein Fibers**:\n   - **Silk**: This fiber is produced by silkworms and is made primarily of fibroin, a protein.\n   - **Wool**: This fiber comes from sheep and is made of keratin, another type of protein.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, the two fibers made of proteins are:\n   - Silk\n   - Wool\n\nSo, the final answer is: **Silk and Wool**."}
