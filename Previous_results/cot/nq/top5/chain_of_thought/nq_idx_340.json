{"question": "what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "chain_of_thought_result": "The first step in the evolution of the eye is the development of light-sensitive cells. These primitive photoreceptor cells allow organisms to detect light and dark, providing a basic advantage for survival by helping them navigate their environment. Over time, these simple light-sensitive structures evolved into more complex forms, eventually leading to the sophisticated eyes we see in many animals today."}
