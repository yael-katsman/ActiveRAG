{"question": "what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body", "chain_of_thought_result": "The two extracellular fluid compartments in the body are:\n\n1. **Interstitial Fluid**: This is the fluid that surrounds the cells in tissues. It acts as a medium for the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste products between blood and cells.\n\n2. **Plasma**: This is the liquid component of blood, which carries cells, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. Plasma constitutes a significant portion of the extracellular fluid and is contained within the blood vessels.\n\nTogether, these two compartments make up the extracellular fluid, which is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and facilitating communication between cells."}
