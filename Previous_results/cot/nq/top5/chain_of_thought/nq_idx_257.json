Dolmens are prehistoric structures consisting of a large stone table-like slab (the capstone) supported by upright stones (the orthostats). They are often associated with burial practices and are found throughout Europe, particularly in regions such as Brittany in France, Ireland, and the British Isles. Other forms of megalithic architecture include stone circles and passage tombs, but dolmens are the most prevalent."}
