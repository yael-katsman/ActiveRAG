{"question": "who coined the phrase let them eat cake", "chain_of_thought_result": "The phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France during the late 18th century. However, there is no definitive evidence that she actually said this. The phrase is believed to have been used to illustrate her ignorance of the struggles of the poor, particularly during a time of famine. The quote is thought to have been popularized by political pamphleteers and revolutionaries who sought to portray her as out of touch with the common people. In summary, while Marie Antoinette is commonly associated with the phrase, its true origins and authenticity remain uncertain."}
