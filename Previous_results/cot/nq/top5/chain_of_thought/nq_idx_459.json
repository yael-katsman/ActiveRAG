{"question": "who were the two mathematicians that invented calculus", "chain_of_thought_result": "The two mathematicians credited with the invention of calculus are Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. \n\n1. **Isaac Newton** (1643-1727) developed his version of calculus in the mid-1660s, primarily focusing on the concepts of motion and change. He referred to his method as \"the method of fluxions.\"\n\n2. **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (1646-1716) developed his version of calculus independently around the same time, publishing his work in 1684. He introduced much of the notation used in calculus today, including the integral sign (\u222b) and the differential (d).\n\nBoth mathematicians made significant contributions to the field, and their work laid the foundation for modern calculus. Their independent discoveries led to a historical dispute over priority, but both are recognized as co-founders of calculus."}
