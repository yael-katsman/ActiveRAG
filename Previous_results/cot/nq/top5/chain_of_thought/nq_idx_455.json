{"question": "who was the drummer with the travelling wilburys", "chain_of_thought_result": "The Traveling Wilburys did not have a designated drummer as part of the group. The band was a supergroup formed in the late 1980s and consisted of several prominent musicians: George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison. While they did have drummers who played on their recordings, such as Jim Keltner, the group itself did not have a permanent drummer. Each member contributed to the music in various ways, including playing instruments and singing."}
