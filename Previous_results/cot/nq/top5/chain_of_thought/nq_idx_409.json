{"question": "a legislative act passed by congress is an example of", "chain_of_thought_result": "A legislative act passed by Congress is an example of a **law** or **statute**. \n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Legislative Acts**: A legislative act refers to a formal decision made by a legislative body, in this case, the United States Congress.\n\n2. **Congress's Role**: Congress is the federal legislative body of the United States, composed of two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n3. **Process of Passing Legislation**: When Congress proposes a bill, it goes through various stages including committee reviews, debates, and votes in both chambers. If both chambers approve the bill, it is sent to the President for approval.\n\n4. **Outcome of Approval**: If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If the President vetoes it, Congress can still enact it by overriding the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers.\n\n5. **Definition of Law/Statute**: Once a bill is signed by the President, it is officially codified and becomes a law or statute, which is enforceable by the government.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that a legislative act passed by Congress is an example of a **law** or **statute**."}
