{"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question of when movies started coming out in color, we can break it down into several key points:\n\n1. **Early Experiments**: The first experiments with color in film began in the late 19th century. For example, in 1902, the film \"A Visit to the Seaside\" used a technique called hand-coloring, where individual frames were painted by hand.\n\n2. **Technological Developments**: The development of more systematic color processes occurred in the 1910s and 1920s. One notable process was the Kinemacolor system, introduced in 1908, which was one of the first successful color processes used in films.\n\n3. **Widespread Use**: The first feature-length color film is often considered to be \"The Toll of the Sea,\" released in 1922, which used the two-color Technicolor process. However, it was not until the late 1930s that color films became more common.\n\n4. **Technicolor's Popularity**: The three-color Technicolor process, which produced more vibrant and realistic colors, was introduced in the 1930s. A landmark film that showcased this technology was \"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\" released in 1938.\n\n5. **Post-War Era**: After World War II, color films became increasingly popular, and by the 1960s, color films were the norm rather than the exception.\n\nIn summary, while color films began to appear in the early 20th century, the widespread adoption of color in movies occurred primarily in the late 1930s and became standard by the 1960s."}
