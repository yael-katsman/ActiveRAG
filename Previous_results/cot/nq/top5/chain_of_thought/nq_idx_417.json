{"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "chain_of_thought_result": "The use of Latin in the Roman Catholic Mass began to decline after the Second Vatican Council, which took place from 1962 to 1965. The council's document \"Sacrosanctum Concilium,\" issued in 1963, encouraged the use of the vernacular (the local language) in the liturgy. \n\nThe official transition away from Latin in the Mass began in 1964, and by 1970, the new Roman Missal was published, which allowed for the Mass to be celebrated in the vernacular. While Latin is still used in some contexts within the Church, the regular celebration of the Mass in Latin was largely replaced by the use of local languages during this period. \n\nIn summary, the significant shift away from Latin in the Mass occurred primarily in the late 1960s and early 1970s, following the Second Vatican Council."}
