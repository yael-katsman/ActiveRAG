{"question": "how many levels of protein structure are there", "chain_of_thought_result": "Proteins have four levels of structure:\n\n1. **Primary Structure**: This is the linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. The specific order of amino acids determines the protein's unique characteristics and function.\n\n2. **Secondary Structure**: This level refers to the local folding of the polypeptide chain into structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms.\n\n3. **Tertiary Structure**: This is the overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, formed by the interactions between the side chains (R groups) of the amino acids. These interactions can include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges.\n\n4. **Quaternary Structure**: This level involves the assembly of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) into a larger functional complex. Not all proteins have a quaternary structure; it is present in proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain.\n\nIn summary, there are four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary."}
