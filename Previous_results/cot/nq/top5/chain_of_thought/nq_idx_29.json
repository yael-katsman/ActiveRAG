{"question": "when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine when aluminum wiring was stopped in Ontario, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Context**: Aluminum wiring was commonly used in residential construction in North America, including Ontario, during the 1960s and 1970s. It was often used as a cheaper alternative to copper wiring.\n\n2. **Identify Issues with Aluminum Wiring**: Over time, it became apparent that aluminum wiring posed safety risks, including a higher likelihood of overheating and electrical fires, especially if not installed properly.\n\n3. **Regulatory Changes**: In response to these safety concerns, regulatory bodies began to take action. The Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) and local building codes would have guidelines regarding the use of aluminum wiring.\n\n4. **Timeline of Changes**: The Canadian Electrical Code began to address the issues with aluminum wiring in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By the 1980s, many jurisdictions, including Ontario, started to discourage or prohibit the use of aluminum wiring in new residential construction.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While aluminum wiring was not officially banned in Ontario at a specific date, its use significantly declined after the 1970s due to safety concerns and changes in building codes. By the 1980s, it was largely phased out in favor of safer alternatives like copper wiring.\n\nTherefore, while there isn't a specific date when aluminum wiring was completely stopped, its use effectively ended in new constructions by the early 1980s in Ontario."}
