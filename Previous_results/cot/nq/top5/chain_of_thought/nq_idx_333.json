{"question": "where does the pulmonary trunk receive blood from", "chain_of_thought_result": "The pulmonary trunk receives blood from the right ventricle of the heart. \n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Heart Structure**: The heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The right ventricle is one of these lower chambers.\n\n2. **Blood Flow**: Deoxygenated blood from the body returns to the heart through the superior and inferior vena cavae into the right atrium.\n\n3. **Right Atrium to Right Ventricle**: From the right atrium, blood flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.\n\n4. **Right Ventricle Contraction**: When the right ventricle contracts, it pumps the deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve.\n\n5. **Pulmonary Trunk Function**: The pulmonary trunk then carries this deoxygenated blood away from the heart towards the lungs for oxygenation.\n\nIn summary, the pulmonary trunk receives blood from the right ventricle of the heart."}
