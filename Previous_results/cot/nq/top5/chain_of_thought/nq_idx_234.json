They were not accessible to the general public.\n\n2. **Introduction of Personal Computers (Late 1970s)**: The late 1970s saw the introduction of personal computers (PCs) like the Apple II (1977) and the IBM PC (1981). These models were more affordable and user-friendly, making them more appealing to consumers.\n\n3. **Home Computer Boom (1980s)**: The 1980s experienced a significant boom in home computing. Companies like Commodore, Atari, and Tandy produced affordable home computers. By the mid-1980s, many households began to acquire computers for personal use.\n\n4. **Educational Adoption (1980s-1990s)**: Schools started integrating computers into classrooms during the 1980s. Programs like the Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT) and initiatives to provide computers to schools helped facilitate this trend. By the 1990s, many schools had computer labs and began incorporating computer literacy into their curricula.\n\n5. **Internet and Multimedia (Mid-1990s)**: The rise of the internet and multimedia capabilities in the mid-1990s further accelerated computer adoption in homes and schools. The availability of educational software and online resources made computers even more valuable in educational settings.\n\n6. **Widespread Adoption (2000s)**: By the early 2000s, computers had become a common fixture in most homes and schools across developed countries. Laptops and later tablets also contributed to this trend.\n\nIn summary, computers became widespread in homes and schools primarily during the 1980s and 1990s, with significant growth continuing into the 2000s."}
