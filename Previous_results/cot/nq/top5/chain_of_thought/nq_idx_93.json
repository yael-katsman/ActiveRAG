{"question": "where is the north pole on the world map", "chain_of_thought_result": "To locate the North Pole on a world map, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Earth's Axis**: The North Pole is located at the northernmost point on Earth, where the Earth's axis of rotation meets its surface.\n\n2. **Identify the Latitude**: The North Pole is situated at 90 degrees North latitude. This means it is the highest point you can reach in terms of latitude.\n\n3. **Locate the Equator**: On a world map, the Equator is marked at 0 degrees latitude. The North Pole is directly above the Equator, at the top of the map.\n\n4. **Find the Top of the Map**: Most world maps are oriented with north at the top. Therefore, the North Pole will be found at the very top center of the map.\n\n5. **Look for the Arctic Region**: The North Pole is located in the Arctic Ocean, surrounded by various landmasses like Greenland, Canada, and Russia. However, the exact point of the North Pole is not on land but rather on sea ice.\n\n6. **Confirm the Location**: On a typical world map, you can find the North Pole at the top center, often marked with a symbol or labeled as \"North Pole.\"\n\nIn summary, the North Pole is located at the top center of a world map, at 90 degrees North latitude."}
