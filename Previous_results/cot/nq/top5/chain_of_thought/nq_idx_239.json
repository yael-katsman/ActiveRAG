{"question": "what type of writing did ancient egypt use", "chain_of_thought_result": "Ancient Egypt primarily used three types of writing systems:\n\n1. **Hieroglyphics**: This is the most well-known form of ancient Egyptian writing. Hieroglyphics consisted of pictorial symbols that represented sounds, objects, or ideas. It was used for religious texts, monumental inscriptions, and official documents.\n\n2. **Hieratic**: This was a cursive form of hieroglyphics used for writing on papyrus. Hieratic was more practical for everyday writing and was commonly used by priests and scribes for administrative and literary texts.\n\n3. **Demotic**: This script evolved from hieratic and became the common script for writing in Egypt during the later periods. Demotic was used for a variety of documents, including legal and commercial texts, and was more simplified than hieratic.\n\nThese writing systems played a crucial role in the administration, culture, and religion of ancient Egypt."}
