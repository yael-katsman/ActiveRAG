{"question": "who makes the important government decisions in an autocracy", "chain_of_thought_result": "In an autocracy, important government decisions are made by a single individual or a small group of individuals who hold absolute power. This can include:\n\n1. **The Autocrat**: The primary decision-maker is often a dictator or a monarch who has centralized authority and makes decisions without the need for consent from a legislative body or the public.\n\n2. **Advisors or Inner Circle**: While the autocrat has the final say, they may rely on a select group of advisors or officials who help formulate policies and strategies. However, these advisors typically do not have the power to challenge the autocrat's decisions.\n\n3. **Military or Security Forces**: In some autocracies, military leaders or security forces may play a significant role in decision-making, especially regarding national security and internal stability.\n\n4. **Political Party (if applicable)**: In some autocratic regimes, a ruling political party may exist, but it usually operates under the control of the autocrat, and its decisions are aligned with the autocrat's directives.\n\nOverall, the key characteristic of an autocracy is that decision-making is concentrated in the hands of one or a few individuals, with little to no input from the general population or democratic institutions."}
