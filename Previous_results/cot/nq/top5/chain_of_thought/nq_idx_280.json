{"question": "when did the legal drinking age changed to 21", "chain_of_thought_result": "The legal drinking age in the United States was changed to 21 with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. This law mandated that states raise and enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 for the purchase and public possession of alcohol. States that did not comply faced a reduction in federal highway funds. The law took effect on July 1, 1987, and since then, 21 has been the legal drinking age across the country."}
