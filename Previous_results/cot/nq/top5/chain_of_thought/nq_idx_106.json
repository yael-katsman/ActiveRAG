{"question": "who's playing in the world series and when is it", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question about who is playing in the World Series and when it is, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Year**: Determine the current year to know which World Series is being referred to.\n\n2. **Check the Teams**: Look up the teams that have qualified for the World Series in that year. This information is usually available on sports news websites or the official Major League Baseball (MLB) website.\n\n3. **Find the Schedule**: Look for the dates of the World Series games. The schedule is typically announced once the teams are determined.\n\n4. **Compile the Information**: Combine the information about the teams and the dates into a clear answer.\n\nSince I don't have real-time data, I recommend checking the latest sports news or the MLB website for the most current information on the World Series teams and schedule."}
