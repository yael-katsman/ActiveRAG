{"question": "what is the breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from atp", "chain_of_thought_result": "When one phosphate group is removed from ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the breakdown product formed is ADP (adenosine diphosphate). \n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Structure of ATP**: ATP consists of three phosphate groups (triphosphate), a ribose sugar, and an adenine base.\n\n2. **Removal of a Phosphate Group**: The removal of one phosphate group from ATP occurs through a hydrolysis reaction, where water is used to break the bond between the second and third phosphate groups.\n\n3. **Formation of ADP**: When the terminal phosphate group (the third phosphate) is removed, ATP is converted into ADP, which has only two phosphate groups.\n\n4. **Release of Energy**: This reaction releases energy, which can be used by the cell for various biological processes.\n\n5. **Chemical Equation**: The reaction can be summarized as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{ADP} + \\text{P}_i + \\text{Energy}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\text{P}_i \\) represents inorganic phosphate.\n\nThus, the final answer is that the breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from ATP is ADP (adenosine diphosphate)."}
