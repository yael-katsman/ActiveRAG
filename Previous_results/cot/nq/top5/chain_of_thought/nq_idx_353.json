{"question": "who is the guy that jumped from space", "chain_of_thought_result": "The guy who famously jumped from space is Felix Baumgartner. He performed a record-breaking skydive from the stratosphere on October 14, 2012, during the Red Bull Stratos project. He jumped from an altitude of approximately 128,000 feet (about 39 kilometers) and became the first person to break the sound barrier without the use of a vehicle, reaching speeds of over 800 miles per hour (1,287 kilometers per hour) during his descent."}
