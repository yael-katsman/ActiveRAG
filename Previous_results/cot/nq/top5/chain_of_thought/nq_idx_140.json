{"question": "where is south pole located on a map", "chain_of_thought_result": "To locate the South Pole on a map, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Continents**: Look for the continent of Antarctica, which is located at the southernmost part of the Earth.\n\n2. **Find the Latitude**: The South Pole is situated at 90 degrees South latitude. This means it is the point where all lines of longitude converge in the southern hemisphere.\n\n3. **Locate the Longitude**: Since the South Pole is at the southernmost point, all longitudes (0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 East and West) converge there. Therefore, you don\u2019t need to focus on a specific longitude.\n\n4. **Look for Markers**: On many maps, the South Pole may be marked with a dot or a specific symbol indicating its location. It is often represented as a small circle or a star at the bottom of the map.\n\n5. **Use a Polar Map**: If you have a polar projection map, the South Pole will be at the center of the map, surrounded by the continent of Antarctica.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to accurately locate the South Pole on a map."}
