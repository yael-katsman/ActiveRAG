{"question": "what is the name of the first earthquake early warning system", "chain_of_thought_result": "The first earthquake early warning system is known as the \"ShakeAlert\" system, which was developed in California. However, it's important to note that earlier systems were also developed in Japan, such as the \"Earthquake Early Warning\" system (EEW) implemented by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in the early 2000s. Therefore, while ShakeAlert is significant in the U.S., Japan's EEW system is one of the earliest comprehensive systems in the world."}
