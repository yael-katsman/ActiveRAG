{"question": "two examples where low voltage transformers are used", "chain_of_thought_result": "Sure! Here are two examples where low voltage transformers are commonly used:\n\n1. **Residential Lighting Systems**: Low voltage transformers are often used in residential lighting applications, such as landscape lighting or under-cabinet lighting. These transformers convert the standard mains voltage (typically 120V or 240V) down to a lower voltage (like 12V or 24V) to power low voltage light fixtures. This not only enhances safety by reducing the risk of electric shock but also allows for more energy-efficient lighting options.\n\n2. **Electronic Devices and Chargers**: Many electronic devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, use low voltage transformers in their power adapters or chargers. These transformers step down the voltage from the wall outlet to a lower voltage suitable for the device (often 5V, 9V, or 12V). This ensures that the devices receive the correct voltage for safe and efficient operation while protecting them from potential damage caused by higher voltages.\n\nThese examples illustrate the practical applications of low voltage transformers in everyday life."}
