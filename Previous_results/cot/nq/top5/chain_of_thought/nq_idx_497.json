{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "chain_of_thought_result": "The air gap on a dishwasher serves several important functions:\n\n1. **Prevention of Backflow**: The primary purpose of the air gap is to prevent wastewater from the sink or drainage system from flowing back into the dishwasher. This is crucial for maintaining hygiene and ensuring that dirty water does not contaminate clean dishes.\n\n2. **Maintaining Water Pressure**: The air gap helps to maintain proper water pressure within the dishwasher. By creating a break in the water line, it allows for the proper flow of water into the dishwasher without interference from back pressure.\n\n3. **Compliance with Plumbing Codes**: Many local plumbing codes require the installation of an air gap as a safety measure. It ensures that the dishwasher is installed in accordance with health and safety regulations.\n\n4. **Visual Indicator**: The air gap is typically a small, visible fixture mounted on the countertop. If water is leaking from the air gap, it serves as a visual indicator that there may be a blockage or issue with the dishwasher or drainage system.\n\n5. **Easy Maintenance**: In case of clogs or drainage issues, the air gap can be easily accessed for cleaning, helping to maintain the overall functionality of the dishwasher.\n\nIn summary, the air gap is a critical component that ensures the safe and effective operation of a dishwasher by preventing contamination and maintaining proper water flow."}
