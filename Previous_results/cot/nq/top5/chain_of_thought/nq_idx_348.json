{"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine when someone is considered under the poverty line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of Poverty Line**: The poverty line is a threshold set by governments or organizations to define the minimum level of income deemed adequate to live in a specific country or region. It varies based on factors such as family size, location, and cost of living.\n\n2. **Identify the Measurement**: Different countries have different methods for measuring poverty. In the United States, for example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publishes annual poverty guidelines based on the federal poverty level (FPL).\n\n3. **Check the Current Poverty Guidelines**: Look up the most recent poverty guidelines for your country or region. For the U.S., this information is available on the HHS website and is updated annually.\n\n4. **Consider Family Size**: The poverty line is often adjusted based on the number of people in a household. Larger families typically have a higher poverty threshold than smaller families.\n\n5. **Calculate Household Income**: Determine the total income of all members of the household. This includes wages, salaries, benefits, and any other sources of income.\n\n6. **Compare Income to the Poverty Line**: If the total household income is below the established poverty line for your family size and location, then you are considered to be living under the poverty line.\n\n7. **Consider Additional Factors**: Some programs may consider additional factors such as expenses, assets, and specific needs (like medical expenses) when determining eligibility for assistance programs.\n\nBy following these steps, you can assess whether an individual or household is considered under the poverty line."}
