{"question": "when was fingerprinting first used by the police", "chain_of_thought_result": "Fingerprinting was first used by the police in the late 19th century. The first systematic use of fingerprints for criminal identification is credited to Sir Edward Henry in 1897 in England. However, the practice of using fingerprints for identification began earlier, with the first known use of fingerprints in a criminal case occurring in Argentina in 1892, when Juan Vucetich used them to solve a murder case. Therefore, while the concept of fingerprinting dates back to earlier uses, its formal adoption by police forces began in the 1890s."}
