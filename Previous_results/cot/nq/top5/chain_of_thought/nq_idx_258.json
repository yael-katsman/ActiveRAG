{"question": "when did the us dollar leave the gold standard", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question of when the US dollar left the gold standard, we can break it down into key historical events:\n\n1. **Gold Standard Definition**: The gold standard is a monetary system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold. Under this system, countries agreed to convert paper money into a fixed amount of gold.\n\n2. **Bretton Woods Agreement (1944)**: After World War II, the Bretton Woods Conference established a new international monetary system. The US dollar was pegged to gold at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce, while other currencies were pegged to the dollar.\n\n3. **Increasing Economic Pressures**: Throughout the 1960s, the US faced increasing economic pressures, including inflation and trade deficits, which led to doubts about the dollar's convertibility into gold.\n\n4. **Nixon's Announcement (1971)**: On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon announced a series of measures known as the \"Nixon Shock.\" This included suspending the convertibility of the US dollar into gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system.\n\n5. **End of the Gold Standard (1973)**: By 1973, the system of fixed exchange rates was replaced by floating exchange rates, marking the definitive end of the gold standard for the US dollar.\n\nIn summary, the US dollar effectively left the gold standard on August 15, 1971, with the announcement by President Nixon, and the transition was completed by 1973."}
