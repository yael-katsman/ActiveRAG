{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question about substances other than water that have hydrogen bonds, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand Hydrogen Bonds**: Hydrogen bonds occur when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) experiences an attraction to another electronegative atom.\n\n2. **Identify Common Molecules**: Look for molecules that contain hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms. \n\n3. **List Examples**:\n   - **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: In ammonia, the hydrogen atoms are bonded to nitrogen, which can form hydrogen bonds with other ammonia molecules or with water.\n   - **Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)**: HF has strong hydrogen bonds due to the high electronegativity of fluorine.\n   - **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, C\u2082H\u2085OH)**: Alcohols have an -OH (hydroxyl) group, allowing them to form hydrogen bonds with other alcohol molecules or water.\n   - **Carboxylic Acids (e.g., Acetic Acid, CH\u2083COOH)**: These compounds can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.\n   - **Amino Acids**: The amine (-NH\u2082) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups in amino acids can participate in hydrogen bonding.\n   - **Nucleic Acids (DNA and RNA)**: The base pairs in DNA (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine) are held together by hydrogen bonds.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that substances other than water that exhibit hydrogen bonding include ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amino acids, and nucleic acids.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nOther than water, substances that have hydrogen bonds include ammonia (NH\u2083), hydrogen fluoride (HF), alcohols (like ethanol), carboxylic acids (like acetic acid), amino acids, and nucleic acids (like DNA and RNA)."}
