{"question": "when did sussex split into east and west", "chain_of_thought_result": "The historic county of Sussex was divided into two separate counties, East Sussex and West Sussex, in 1974. This division was part of the Local Government Act 1972, which reorganized local government in England and Wales. The split aimed to create more manageable administrative areas.
