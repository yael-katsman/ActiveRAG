{"question": "where does the sun hit the us first", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine where the sun hits the U.S. first, we need to consider the geography and time zones of the country. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Geographical Location**: The U.S. is located in North America and spans several time zones from east to west.\n\n2. **Easternmost Point**: The easternmost point of the U.S. is Point Udall in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but if we focus on the mainland, the easternmost point is West Quoddy Head in Maine.\n\n3. **Time Zones**: The U.S. has multiple time zones, with the Atlantic Time Zone being the furthest east, followed by Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific Time Zones.\n\n4. **Sunrise Timing**: The sun rises in the east and moves westward. Therefore, locations in the easternmost time zone will experience sunrise before those in the western time zones.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The first place in the U.S. to see the sunrise is generally considered to be West Quoddy Head in Maine, as it is the easternmost point on the mainland. However, if we include territories, the U.S. Virgin Islands would see the sun first.\n\nSo, the answer is: **West Quoddy Head in Maine is the first place in the U.S. to see the sunrise on the mainland.**"}
