{"question": "chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts", "chain_of_thought_result": "The chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts are known as **hormones**. \n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Definition of Plant Hormones**: Plant hormones, also called phytohormones, are signaling molecules that regulate various aspects of plant growth and development.\n\n2. **Production Sites**: These hormones are typically produced in specific parts of the plant, such as the roots, stems, leaves, and fruits.\n\n3. **Transport Mechanism**: Once produced, hormones are transported to other parts of the plant where they exert their effects.\n\n4. **Functions**: Plant hormones play crucial roles in processes such as cell division, elongation, flowering, fruiting, and responses to environmental stimuli.\n\n5. **Types of Hormones**: Common types of plant hormones include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, and abscisic acid, each with specific functions and effects on plant growth.\n\nIn summary, the answer is **hormones**."}
