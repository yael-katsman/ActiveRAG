{"question": "when did the study of media effects begin", "chain_of_thought_result": "The study of media effects began in the early 20th century, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Early Interest**: The rise of mass media, especially with the advent of radio and film, sparked interest in understanding how these new forms of communication influenced audiences.\n\n2. **The Payne Fund Studies (1929-1932)**: One of the first systematic studies of media effects was conducted by the Payne Fund, which researched the impact of movies on children and adolescents. This marked a significant step in media effects research.\n\n3. **The Hypodermic Needle Model (1930s)**: During this time, the hypodermic needle model emerged, suggesting that media messages were directly injected into the minds of passive audiences, leading to immediate and powerful effects.\n\n4. **World War II Research**: The effects of propaganda during World War II further propelled research into media effects, as governments sought to understand how media could influence public opinion and behavior.\n\n5. **Post-War Research**: After the war, scholars like Paul Lazarsfeld and his colleagues conducted studies that began to challenge the simplistic views of media effects, introducing concepts like selective exposure and the two-step flow of communication.\n\n6. **Continued Development**: Throughout the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the study of media effects has evolved, incorporating various theories and methodologies, including cultivation theory, agenda-setting, and framing.\n\nIn summary, the study of media effects began in the early 20th century, with significant developments occurring in the 1920s and 1930s, and has continued to evolve ever since."}
