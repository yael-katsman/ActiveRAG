Dolmens are prehistoric structures consisting of a large flat stone (the capstone) supported by upright stones (the orthostats). They are often associated with burial sites and are found throughout Europe, particularly in regions like Brittany in France, the British Isles, and parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Other forms of megalithic architecture include stone circles and passage tombs, but dolmens are the most prevalent type."}
