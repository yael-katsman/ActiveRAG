{"question": "which greek god flew too close to the sun", "chain_of_thought_result": "The Greek god who flew too close to the sun is Icarus. In mythology, Icarus is the son of Daedalus, a skilled craftsman. Daedalus created wings made of feathers and wax for himself and Icarus to escape from Crete. Despite his father's warnings not to fly too high or too low, Icarus became overconfident and flew too close to the sun. The heat melted the wax in his wings, causing him to fall into the sea and drown."}
