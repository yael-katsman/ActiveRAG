These models were more affordable and accessible to the general public.\n\n3. **Growth in Popularity (1980s)**: The 1980s marked a significant increase in the popularity of personal computers. Companies like Commodore and Tandy also produced affordable PCs, making them more common in homes. By the mid-1980s, many families began to own computers.\n\n4. **Integration into Education (1980s-1990s)**: Schools began to adopt computers in the classroom during the 1980s.

The rise of the internet and multimedia software further encouraged their use for both educational purposes and personal entertainment.\n\n6. **Continued Growth (2000s-Present)**: The 2000s saw an explosion in the use of computers and the internet in both homes and schools, with laptops and later tablets becoming prevalent. Technology became an integral part of education, with many schools implementing one-to-one computing programs.\n\nIn summary, computers became widespread in homes and schools primarily during the 1980s and 1990s, with significant growth continuing into the 2000s and beyond."}
