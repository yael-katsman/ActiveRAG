{"question": "who laid the foundation of school of possibilism", "chain_of_thought_result": "The foundation of the school of possibilism was laid by the French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache. He is known for his contributions to geography and for promoting the idea that human activities and culture can shape the environment, as opposed to the deterministic view that the environment solely dictates human actions. This perspective emphasizes the possibilities available to humans in adapting to and modifying their environment."}
