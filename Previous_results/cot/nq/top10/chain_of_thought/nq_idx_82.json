{"question": "when was fingerprinting first used by the police", "chain_of_thought_result": "Fingerprinting was first used by the police in the late 19th century. The first systematic use of fingerprinting for criminal identification occurred in 1892 when Sir Francis Galton published a book on the uniqueness of fingerprints. However, it was in 1901 that an official fingerprint identification system was established by an Argentine police official named Juan Vucetich. In the United States, fingerprinting was adopted by the New York City Police Department in 1903. Therefore, while the concept was explored in the 1890s, the practical application in policing began around 1901-1903."}
