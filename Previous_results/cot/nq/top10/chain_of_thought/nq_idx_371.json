{"question": "how long do former presidents get secret service protection", "chain_of_thought_result": "Former presidents of the United States are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. This was established by the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012, which restored lifetime protection for all former presidents and their immediate families. Prior to this act, former presidents who left office after January 1, 1997, were only provided with Secret Service protection for a period of 10 years. However, the law now ensures that all former presidents, regardless of when they left office, receive protection for life."}
