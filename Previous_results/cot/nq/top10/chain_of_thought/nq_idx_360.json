{"question": "how many levels of protein structure are there", "chain_of_thought_result": "Proteins have four levels of structure:\n\n1. **Primary Structure**: This is the linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. The specific order of amino acids is determined by the gene encoding the protein.\n\n2. **Secondary Structure**: This level refers to the local folding of the polypeptide chain into structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone atoms.\n\n3. **Tertiary Structure**: This level involves the overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, which is formed by the interactions between the side chains (R groups) of the amino acids. These interactions can include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and disulfide bridges.\n\n4. **Quaternary Structure**: This level pertains to the assembly of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) into a single functional protein complex. Not all proteins have quaternary structure; it is present in proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide chain.\n\nIn summary, there are four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary."}
