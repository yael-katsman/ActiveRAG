{"question": "chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts", "chain_of_thought_result": "The chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts are known as **hormones**. Plant hormones, or phytohormones, are signaling molecules that regulate various physiological processes, including growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. Examples of plant hormones include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, and abscisic acid. Each of these hormones plays a specific role in coordinating growth and responses throughout the plant."}
