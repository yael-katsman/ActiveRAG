{"question": "what are the four requirements to establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter", "chain_of_thought_result": "To establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter, four key requirements must typically be met:\n\n1. **Existence of a Duty of Care**: The defendant must have owed a duty of care to the victim. This means that there was a legal obligation for the defendant to act in a way that would not cause harm to the victim. This duty can arise from various relationships, such as that of a doctor to a patient or a driver to other road users.\n\n2. **Breach of Duty**: The defendant must have breached that duty of care. This involves demonstrating that the defendant's conduct fell below the standard of care expected from a reasonable person in similar circumstances. The breach must be significant enough to be considered a departure from what is expected.\n\n3. **Causation**: There must be a direct causal link between the defendant's breach of duty and the victim's death. This means that the actions (or inactions) of the defendant must have directly contributed to the circumstances that led to the victim's death.\n\n4. **Gross Negligence**: The negligence must be classified as \"gross.\" This means that the defendant's conduct was so severe that it amounted to a criminal act, rather than just a civil wrong. The standard for gross negligence is typically higher than ordinary negligence and involves a serious disregard for the life and safety of others.\n\nThese four elements must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction of gross negligence manslaughter to occur."}
