{"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "chain_of_thought_result": "The practice of saying Mass in Latin began to change after the Second Vatican Council, which took place from 1962 to 1965. The council introduced reforms that allowed for the use of vernacular languages in the liturgy. The official implementation of these changes began with the publication of the new Roman Missal in 1970, which permitted Mass to be celebrated in the local languages rather than exclusively in Latin. Therefore, while Latin was still used in some contexts, the widespread practice of saying Mass in Latin effectively ended around the early 1970s."}
