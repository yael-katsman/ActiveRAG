{"question": "two examples where low voltage transformers are used", "chain_of_thought_result": "Sure! Here are two examples where low voltage transformers are commonly used:\n\n1. **Residential Lighting Systems**: Low voltage transformers are often used in residential lighting systems, particularly for landscape lighting and low-voltage indoor lighting. These transformers convert standard line voltage (typically 120V or 240V) down to a lower voltage (such as 12V or 24V) to power fixtures safely and efficiently. This is especially useful for outdoor lighting, where safety is a concern, as lower voltage reduces the risk of electric shock.\n\n2. **Electronic Devices and Appliances**: Many electronic devices and appliances, such as chargers for smartphones, tablets, and laptops, utilize low voltage transformers. These transformers step down the high voltage from the wall outlet to a lower voltage suitable for the device, typically around 5V, 9V, or 12V. This ensures that the devices operate safely and effectively without the risk of damage from higher voltages.\n\nThese examples illustrate the versatility and importance of low voltage transformers in everyday applications."}
