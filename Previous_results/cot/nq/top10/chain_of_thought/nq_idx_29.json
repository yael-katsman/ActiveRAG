{"question": "when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine when aluminum wiring was no longer used in Ontario, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Context**: Aluminum wiring was commonly used in residential construction in North America during the 1960s and 1970s. However, it was later found to have safety issues, particularly related to overheating and fire hazards.\n\n2. **Identify Regulations**: The Ontario Electrical Safety Code (OESC) governs electrical installations in Ontario. Changes to this code would indicate when certain materials, like aluminum wiring, were phased out.\n\n3. **Research Code Changes**: The OESC has undergone several revisions over the years. Significant changes regarding aluminum wiring were made in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n4. **Determine the Cut-off Year**: While aluminum wiring was not outright banned, its use was discouraged, and stricter regulations were put in place. By the early 1980s, the use of aluminum wiring in new residential construction had significantly declined.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While aluminum wiring was still permitted in some applications, its widespread use in residential wiring effectively stopped around the early 1980s in Ontario due to safety concerns and changes in electrical codes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the use of aluminum wiring in new residential construction in Ontario effectively stopped in the early 1980s."}
