{"question": "when did the three little pigs come out", "chain_of_thought_result": "The story of \"The Three Little Pigs\" is a traditional folk tale that has been passed down through generations. Its origins can be traced back to the 19th century, with the earliest known publication appearing in 1843 in a collection of stories by James Orchard Halliwell. However, the tale itself likely existed in oral tradition long before that. Therefore, while the specific publication date is 1843, the story itself is much older."}
