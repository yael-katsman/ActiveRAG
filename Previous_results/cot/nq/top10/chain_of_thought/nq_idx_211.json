{"question": "rain sleet or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called", "chain_of_thought_result": "Rain, sleet, or snow that contains a high concentration of acids is called \"acid precipitation\" or \"acid rain.\" This phenomenon occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the atmosphere, often from industrial processes and vehicle emissions. These pollutants can react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acids, which then fall to the ground as precipitation."}
