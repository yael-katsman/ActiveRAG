{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "chain_of_thought_result": "Hydrogen bonds are a type of weak chemical bond that occurs when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) experiences an attraction to another electronegative atom. Here are some examples of substances that exhibit hydrogen bonding, other than water:\n\n1. **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: Ammonia has hydrogen bonds due to the presence of nitrogen, which is electronegative. This leads to a significant amount of hydrogen bonding between ammonia molecules.\n\n2. **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF)**: Hydrofluoric acid exhibits strong hydrogen bonding because of the highly electronegative fluorine atom.\n\n3. **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, Methanol)**: Alcohols contain hydroxyl (-OH) groups, which can form hydrogen bonds with other alcohol molecules or with water.\n\n4. **Carboxylic Acids (e.g., Acetic Acid)**: These compounds have both a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group, allowing them to form hydrogen bonds with themselves and with other molecules.\n\n5. **DNA**: The base pairs in DNA (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine) are held together by hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the structure of the double helix.\n\n6. **Proteins**: Hydrogen bonds play a significant role in stabilizing the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins, such as alpha helices and beta sheets.\n\n7. **Nucleic Acids**: Similar to DNA, RNA also contains hydrogen bonds that help stabilize its structure.\n\n8. **Some Sugars (e.g., Glucose)**: Sugars can form hydrogen bonds due to their hydroxyl groups, which can interact with water and other molecules.\n\nThese examples illustrate that hydrogen bonding is a common interaction in many biological and chemical systems, contributing to the properties and behaviors of various substances."}
