{"question": "when did the first immigrants come to hawaii", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine when the first immigrants came to Hawaii, we can break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Pre-Contact Period**: The first settlers of Hawaii were Polynesians who arrived in canoes from other Pacific islands. This migration is believed to have occurred around 1,500 years ago, with estimates placing the arrival of the first Polynesian settlers around 300 to 800 AD.\n\n2. **European Contact**: The first recorded European contact with Hawaii was in 1778 when British explorer Captain James Cook arrived. This marked the beginning of significant outside influence and immigration.\n\n3. **Post-Contact Immigration**: Following Cook's arrival, Hawaii saw an influx of immigrants from various countries, including the United States, China, Japan, Portugal, and the Philippines, particularly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as labor was needed for the sugar plantations.\n\nIn summary, the first immigrants to Hawaii were Polynesians who arrived around 300 to 800 AD."}
