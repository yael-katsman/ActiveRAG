{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "chain_of_thought_result": "The air gap on a dishwasher serves an important function in preventing contamination of the clean water supply. Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of its purpose:\n\n1. **Definition of Air Gap**: An air gap is a physical separation between the dishwasher's drain line and the household plumbing system. It is typically a small device mounted on the countertop or sink.\n\n2. **Preventing Backflow**: The primary function of the air gap is to prevent backflow of dirty water from the sink or drain into the dishwasher. This is crucial because it ensures that any wastewater does not contaminate the clean water that is used for washing dishes.\n\n3. **Creating a Barrier**: The air gap creates a barrier by allowing air to enter the drain line. This air space prevents siphoning, which could occur if there is a drop in water pressure in the plumbing system, potentially pulling dirty water back into the dishwasher.\n\n4. **Compliance with Codes**: Many plumbing codes require the installation of an air gap for dishwashers to ensure safe and sanitary operation. This is especially important in areas where the risk of contamination is higher.\n\n5. **Visual Indicator**: The air gap also serves as a visual indicator that the dishwasher is properly connected to the plumbing system. If water is seen flowing out of the air gap, it may indicate a blockage in the drain line or a problem with the dishwasher.\n\n6. **Maintenance**: Regular maintenance of the air gap is important to ensure it functions properly. It should be kept clean and free of debris to prevent clogs.\n\nIn summary, the air gap on a dishwasher is a critical component that helps maintain hygiene and safety by preventing the backflow of contaminated water into the dishwasher."}
