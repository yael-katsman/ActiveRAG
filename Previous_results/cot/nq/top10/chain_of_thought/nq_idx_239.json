{"question": "what type of writing did ancient egypt use", "chain_of_thought_result": "Ancient Egypt primarily used a writing system known as **hieroglyphics**. This system consisted of a combination of logographic and alphabetic elements, using symbols and pictures to represent sounds, words, and concepts. \n\n1. **Hieroglyphics**: This was the formal writing system used for religious texts, monumental inscriptions, and official documents. It included over 700 symbols and was often carved into stone or painted on temple walls.\n\n2. **Hieratic**: This was a cursive form of hieroglyphics used for writing on papyrus and for everyday purposes. It was simpler and faster to write than hieroglyphics.\n\n3. **Demotic**: This evolved from hieratic and became the common script for daily use in Egypt during the later periods. It was used for administrative, legal, and commercial documents.\n\n4. **Coptic**: This is the latest stage of the Egyptian language and used the Greek alphabet along with some hieroglyphic characters. It emerged in the early Christian period and is still used in the liturgical context by the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nIn summary, the main types of writing used in ancient Egypt were hieroglyphics, hieratic, demotic, and later Coptic."}
