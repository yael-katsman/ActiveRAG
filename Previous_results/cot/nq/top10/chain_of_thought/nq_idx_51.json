{"question": "who has majority in the house and senate", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine who has the majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Current Congress**: Check which Congress is currently in session (e.g., the 117th Congress, which began in January 2021, or the 118th Congress, which began in January 2023).\n\n2. **Check the Composition of the House**: Look up the current number of representatives in the House of Representatives. As of the latest information, there are 435 voting members. A majority would require at least 218 votes.\n\n3. **Check the Composition of the Senate**: The Senate consists of 100 members. A majority would require at least 51 votes (or 50 votes plus the Vice President's tie-breaking vote).\n\n4. **Look Up Current Party Affiliations**: Research the current party affiliations of the members in both chambers. This information can typically be found on official government websites or reputable news sources.\n\n5. **Determine the Majority**: \n   - For the House, count the number of seats held by each party.\n   - For the Senate, do the same.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the counts, identify which party holds the majority in each chamber.\n\nAs of my last update in October 2023, the Democratic Party held a slim majority in the Senate, while the Republican Party had a majority in the House of Representatives. However, please verify this information with the latest sources, as political dynamics can change frequently."}
