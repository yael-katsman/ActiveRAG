{"question": "where is the north pole on the world map", "chain_of_thought_result": "To locate the North Pole on a world map, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Equator**: Start by finding the Equator, which is the horizontal line that divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. It is located at 0 degrees latitude.\n\n2. **Locate the Northern Hemisphere**: Since the North Pole is in the Northern Hemisphere, focus on the upper half of the map above the Equator.\n\n3. **Find the North Pole**: The North Pole is located at 90 degrees North latitude. On a world map, this point is typically found at the very top center of the map.\n\n4. **Consider the Context**: The North Pole is situated in the Arctic Ocean and is surrounded by sea ice. It is not on any landmass, so you will not see any countries or cities marked at this point.\n\n5. **Visualize the Position**: If you have a globe, you can easily see that the North Pole is the point where all lines of longitude converge at the top of the globe.\n\nIn summary, the North Pole is located at the top center of a world map, at 90 degrees North latitude."}
