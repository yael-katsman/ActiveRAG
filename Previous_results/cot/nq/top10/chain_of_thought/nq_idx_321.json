{"question": "when did the study of media effects begin", "chain_of_thought_result": "The study of media effects began in the early 20th century, particularly around the time of World War I. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Early Interest (1920s)**: The first significant studies on media effects emerged in the 1920s, particularly with the rise of mass communication technologies like radio and film. Researchers began to explore how these new media influenced public opinion and behavior.\n\n2. **The Payne Fund Studies (1930s)**: A landmark series of studies known as the Payne Fund Studies was conducted in the late 1920s and early 1930s. These studies examined the effects of movies on children and adolescents, marking a significant moment in media effects research.\n\n3. **World War II and Propaganda (1940s)**: During World War II, the U.S. government conducted research on the effects of propaganda and media on public attitudes and behaviors, further solidifying the importance of studying media effects.\n\n4. **The 1950s and 1960s**: This period saw the emergence of more systematic research methodologies and theories, such as the Hypodermic Needle Model, which suggested that media messages directly and uniformly influenced audiences.\n\n5. **Cultural and Social Context (1970s onward)**: As the field evolved, researchers began to consider the role of social and cultural contexts in media effects, leading to more nuanced theories like the Uses and Gratifications Theory and the Agenda-Setting Theory.\n\nIn summary, while the study of media effects began in earnest in the 1920s, it gained significant traction through the 1930s and beyond, evolving into a complex field of research over the decades."}
