{"question": "where does the pulmonary trunk receive blood from", "chain_of_thought_result": "The pulmonary trunk receives blood from the right ventricle of the heart. \n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Heart Structure**: The heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The right ventricle is one of these lower chambers.\n\n2. **Function of the Right Ventricle**: The right ventricle is responsible for pumping deoxygenated blood (blood that has delivered oxygen to the body and collected carbon dioxide) into the pulmonary circulation.\n\n3. **Pulmonary Trunk**: When the right ventricle contracts, it sends the deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary trunk.\n\n4. **Pathway of Blood**: The pulmonary trunk then branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries, which carry the blood to the lungs for oxygenation.\n\nIn summary, the pulmonary trunk receives deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart."}
