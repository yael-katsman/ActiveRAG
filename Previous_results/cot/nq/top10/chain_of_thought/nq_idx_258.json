{"question": "when did the us dollar leave the gold standard", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question of when the US dollar left the gold standard, we can break it down into key historical events:\n\n1. **Gold Standard Introduction**: The US formally adopted the gold standard in the late 19th century, with the Gold Standard Act of 1900.\n\n2. **Great Depression**: During the Great Depression in the 1930s, the US government faced economic challenges and suspended the gold standard for domestic transactions. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order that required citizens to exchange their gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates for US dollars.\n\n3. **Bretton Woods Agreement**: After World War II, the Bretton Woods system was established in 1944, which pegged the US dollar to gold at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce. Other currencies were pegged to the US dollar.\n\n4. **End of Bretton Woods**: In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the US faced inflation and trade deficits, leading to a loss of confidence in the dollar. In 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system.\n\n5. **Final Departure from Gold Standard**: The formal end of the gold standard for the US dollar occurred in 1973 when the system transitioned to a fiat currency system, where the dollar was no longer backed by gold.\n\nIn summary, the US dollar effectively left the gold standard in 1971 with Nixon's announcement, and the transition was completed in 1973."}
