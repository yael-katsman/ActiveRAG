{"question": "where does the sun hit the us first", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine where the sun hits the U.S. first, we need to consider the geography and time zones of the country. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Geographical Location**: The U.S. is located in North America and spans several time zones from east to west.\n\n2. **Easternmost Point**: The easternmost point of the U.S. is Point Udall in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but if we focus on the mainland, the easternmost point is West Quoddy Head in Maine.\n\n3. **Time Zones**: The U.S. has multiple time zones, including Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific. The Eastern Time Zone is the first to experience sunrise.\n\n4. **Sunrise Timing**: The sun rises in the east and moves westward. Therefore, locations in the Eastern Time Zone will see the sun before those in the other time zones.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The first place in the continental U.S. to see the sunrise is typically West Quoddy Head in Maine, as it is the easternmost point of the mainland.\n\nSo, the answer is: **West Quoddy Head in Maine is where the sun hits the U.S. first.**"}
