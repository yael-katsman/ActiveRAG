{"question": "who sings the theme song to all that", "chain_of_thought_result": "The theme song to \"All That\" was performed by the cast of the show, particularly by the musical group called \"The Black Eyed Peas\" for the 1994 version. However, the original theme song was performed by the cast members themselves. The show has had different iterations and revivals, so the theme song may have varied slightly in different seasons."}
