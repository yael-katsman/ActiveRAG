{"question": "when did ireland gain its independence from england", "chain_of_thought_result": "Ireland gained its independence from England in several stages. The most significant date is January 21, 1919, when the Irish Parliament (D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann) declared independence from Britain. However, this led to the Anglo-Irish War (1919-1921).\n\nThe conflict concluded with the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was signed on December 6, 1921. This treaty established the Irish Free State, which came into effect on December 6, 1922. The Irish Free State was a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth.\n\nIt's important to note that while the Irish Free State marked a significant step towards full independence, it did not include the entire island of Ireland, as Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. Ireland eventually became a republic with the adoption of the Republic of Ireland Act in 1948, which came into effect on April 18, 1949."}
