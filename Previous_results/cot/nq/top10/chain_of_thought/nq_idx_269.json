We need to specify which country's election commission we are discussing.\n\n2. **Research the Structure**: In many countries, the election commission is headed by a chairman or a chief election commissioner. \n\n3. **Check Current Leadership**: For the specific country in question, we would need to look up the current chairman or chief election commissioner. This information can typically be found on the official website of the election commission or through recent news articles.\n\n4. **Provide the Answer**: Once we have identified the country and the current chairman, we can provide a clear answer.\n\nFor example, if we are discussing India, the answer would be: \"The Chief Election Commissioner of India acts as the chairman of the Election Commission of India.\" If we are discussing the United States, the answer might be different, as the U.S. does not have a single national election commission but rather state-level election officials.\n\nPlease specify the country if you need a more precise answer!"}
