{"question": "where does the cell spend most of its time in the cell cycle", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine where the cell spends most of its time in the cell cycle, we can break down the cell cycle into its main phases:\n\n1. **Interphase**: This is the longest phase of the cell cycle and is divided into three sub-phases:\n   - **G1 phase (Gap 1)**: The cell grows and carries out normal functions.\n   - **S phase (Synthesis)**: The cell replicates its DNA.\n   - **G2 phase (Gap 2)**: The cell continues to grow and prepares for mitosis.\n\n2. **M phase (Mitosis)**: This is the phase where the cell divides into two daughter cells. It includes several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis.\n\nNow, considering the duration of each phase:\n\n- **Interphase** (G1, S, and G2 combined) typically takes up about 90% of the total cell cycle time.\n- **M phase** is much shorter, usually taking only about 10% of the total time.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**The cell spends most of its time in Interphase.**"}
