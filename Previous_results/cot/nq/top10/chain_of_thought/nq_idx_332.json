{"question": "who coined the phrase let them eat cake", "chain_of_thought_result": "The phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France during the late 18th century. However, there is no definitive evidence that she actually said this. The phrase is believed to have been used to illustrate her perceived indifference to the plight of the poor, particularly during a time of famine in France. The quote is thought to have originated from a misinterpretation or a paraphrase of her response to the news that the peasants had no bread to eat. The phrase has since become emblematic of the disconnect between the ruling class and the common people."}
