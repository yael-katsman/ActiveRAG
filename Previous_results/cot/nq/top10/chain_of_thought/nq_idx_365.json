{"question": "who makes the important government decisions in an autocracy", "chain_of_thought_result": "In an autocracy, important government decisions are made by a single individual or a small group of individuals who hold significant power and authority. This can include:\n\n1. **The Autocrat**: The primary decision-maker is often the autocrat, who may be a dictator, monarch, or leader with absolute power. This person has the final say in government policies and actions.\n\n2. **Advisors and Close Associates**: While the autocrat has ultimate authority, they may rely on a select group of advisors or officials to help formulate and implement decisions. However, these individuals typically do not have the same level of power as the autocrat.\n\n3. **Political Party or Elite Group**: In some autocracies, a ruling party or elite group may also play a role in decision-making, but their influence is usually subordinate to that of the autocrat.\n\n4. **Lack of Public Input**: In an autocracy, there is generally little to no public participation in the decision-making process, as dissent and opposition are often suppressed.\n\nOverall, the concentration of power in the hands of one or a few individuals characterizes the decision-making process in an autocracy."}
