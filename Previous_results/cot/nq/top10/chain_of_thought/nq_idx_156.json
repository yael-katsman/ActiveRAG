{"question": "who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition", "chain_of_thought_result": "The composer who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition is Arnold Schoenberg. He developed this method in the early 20th century as a way to organize pitch in a more systematic manner, moving away from the tonal system that had dominated Western music for centuries. The twelve-tone technique involves using all twelve notes of the chromatic scale in a specific order (a tone row) to create a composition, ensuring that no single note is emphasized over others."}
