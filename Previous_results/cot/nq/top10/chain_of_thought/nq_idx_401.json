{"question": "which animal on earth has the longest life span", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine which animal on Earth has the longest lifespan, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Lifespan**: Lifespan refers to the length of time an organism is expected to live under normal circumstances.\n\n2. **Research Animal Lifespans**: Various animals have been studied for their lifespans, including both terrestrial and marine species.\n\n3. **Identify Candidates**: Some of the animals known for their long lifespans include:\n   - **Greenland Shark**: Estimated to live up to 400 years.\n   - **Bowhead Whale**: Can live over 200 years.\n   - **Tortoises**: Some species, like the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, can live over 100 years.\n   - **Certain types of clams**: For example, the ocean quahog clam can live over 500 years.\n\n4. **Evaluate Evidence**: Among these candidates, the Greenland shark is often cited as the longest-living vertebrate, with studies suggesting ages of up to 400 years. However, the ocean quahog clam has been documented to live over 500 years.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available evidence, the animal with the longest confirmed lifespan is the **ocean quahog clam**, which can live over 500 years.\n\nFinal Answer: The ocean quahog clam has the longest lifespan, living over 500 years."}
