{"question": "which layer of the osi model handles physical addressing", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine which layer of the OSI model handles physical addressing, we can break down the OSI model into its seven layers:\n\n1. **Application Layer** - This layer is responsible for application-level protocols and user interface.\n2. **Presentation Layer** - This layer translates data formats and handles encryption and compression.\n3. **Session Layer** - This layer manages sessions and controls the dialogues between computers.\n4. **Transport Layer** - This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and error recovery.\n5. **Network Layer** - This layer handles logical addressing and routing of packets.\n6. **Data Link Layer** - This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and handles physical addressing (such as MAC addresses).\n7. **Physical Layer** - This layer deals with the physical connection between devices, including cables and signaling.\n\nNow, focusing on the question about physical addressing, we see that the **Data Link Layer** is the one that specifically handles physical addressing, such as MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, which are used to identify devices on a local network.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**Data Link Layer**."}
