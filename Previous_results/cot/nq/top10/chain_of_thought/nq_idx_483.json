{"question": "what are the two extracellular fluid compartments in the body", "chain_of_thought_result": "The two extracellular fluid compartments in the body are:\n\n1. **Interstitial Fluid**: This is the fluid that surrounds the cells in tissues. It acts as a medium for the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste products between blood and cells.\n\n2. **Plasma**: This is the liquid component of blood that carries cells, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. Plasma makes up a significant portion of the blood volume.\n\nTogether, these compartments make up the extracellular fluid, which is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and facilitating cellular functions."}
