{"question": "when did the legal drinking age changed to 21", "chain_of_thought_result": "The legal drinking age in the United States was changed to 21 with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. This law was enacted on July 17, 1984, and it required all states to raise and enforce a minimum legal drinking age of 21 for purchasing and publicly possessing alcohol. States that did not comply faced a reduction in federal highway funds. As a result, all states eventually adopted the 21-year-old minimum drinking age."}
