{"question": "who were the two mathematicians that invented calculus", "chain_of_thought_result": "The two mathematicians credited with the invention of calculus are Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. \n\n1. **Isaac Newton** (1643-1727) developed his version of calculus in the mid-1660s, which he referred to as \"the method of fluxions.\" His work focused on the concepts of motion and change, particularly in relation to physics.\n\n2. **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (1646-1716) independently developed his version of calculus around the same time, publishing his first paper on the subject in 1684. He introduced much of the notation used in calculus today, such as the integral sign (\u222b) and the notation for derivatives (d/dx).\n\nBoth mathematicians made significant contributions to the development of calculus, and their work laid the foundation for modern mathematics. Their contributions were developed independently, leading to a historical dispute over priority, but both are recognized as co-founders of calculus."}
