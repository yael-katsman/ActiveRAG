{"question": "what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "chain_of_thought_result": "The first step in the evolution of the eye is the development of light-sensitive cells. These primitive photoreceptor cells allow organisms to detect light and dark, providing a basic advantage for survival by helping them navigate their environment. Over time, these simple light-sensitive structures evolved into more complex forms, leading to the development of various types of eyes in different species."}
