{"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine when someone is considered under the poverty line, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition**: The poverty line is a threshold set by the government that indicates the minimum level of income deemed adequate to live in a specific country or region. Those earning below this threshold are considered to be living in poverty.\n\n2. **Identify the Measurement**: Different countries use different methods to measure poverty. In the United States, for example, the poverty line is determined by the U.S. Census Bureau and is based on the size of the household and the total income.\n\n3. **Check the Income Threshold**: The poverty line is updated annually and varies based on household size. For instance, in the U.S., there are specific income thresholds for individuals, families of two, three, and so on. You can find the current poverty thresholds on government websites, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n4. **Consider Geographic Variations**: Some regions may have different poverty thresholds due to the cost of living. For example, urban areas may have higher thresholds compared to rural areas.\n\n5. **Evaluate Household Income**: To determine if someone is under the poverty line, compare their total household income (from all sources) to the established poverty threshold for their household size.\n\n6. **Account for Other Factors**: In some cases, additional factors such as family composition, age, and disability status may also influence poverty status.\n\n7. **Review Assistance Programs**: Many government assistance programs use the poverty line to determine eligibility for support. Being below the poverty line may qualify individuals or families for various forms of aid.\n\nBy following these steps, you can assess whether an individual or household is considered to be under the poverty line based on their income and household size relative to the established thresholds."}
