{"question": "who received the most (but not a majority of) electoral votes in 1824", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine who received the most electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, we need to look at the candidates and the electoral vote distribution.\n\n1. **Candidates**: The main candidates in the 1824 election were John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay.\n\n2. **Electoral Votes**: In the 1824 election, Andrew Jackson received the most electoral votes, totaling 99. However, he did not secure a majority of the electoral votes, as a majority would have required at least 131 out of 261 electoral votes.\n\n3. **Outcome**: Since no candidate received a majority, the election was decided by the House of Representatives, where John Quincy Adams was ultimately chosen as president.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **Andrew Jackson received the most electoral votes in 1824, with 99 votes.**"}
