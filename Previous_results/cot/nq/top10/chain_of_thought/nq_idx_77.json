{"question": "what is the breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from atp", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine the breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from ATP (adenosine triphosphate), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of ATP**: ATP consists of three phosphate groups (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3), a ribose sugar, and an adenine base.\n\n2. **Identify the Reaction**: When one phosphate group is removed from ATP, a hydrolysis reaction occurs. This typically involves the breaking of a high-energy bond between the phosphate groups.\n\n3. **Determine the Product**: When the terminal phosphate group (the \u03b3-phosphate) is removed from ATP, the product formed is ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and an inorganic phosphate (Pi).\n\n4. **Write the Reaction**: The reaction can be summarized as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{ADP} + \\text{Pi}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from ATP is ADP (adenosine diphosphate). \n\nSo, the final answer is: **ADP (adenosine diphosphate)**."}
