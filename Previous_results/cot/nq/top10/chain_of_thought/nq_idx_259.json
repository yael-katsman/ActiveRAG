{"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question of when movies started coming out in color, we can break it down into several key steps:\n\n1. **Early Film History**: The earliest films were made in black and white. The first motion pictures were created in the late 19th century.\n\n2. **Color Techniques in the Early 1900s**: The first attempts at color films began in the early 1900s. Techniques like hand-coloring individual frames and using tinted films were used, but these were not practical for full-length features.\n\n3. **Two-Color Processes**: In the 1910s and 1920s, two-color processes such as Kinemacolor and Technicolor (two-color) were developed. These allowed for limited color films, but they were not widely adopted.\n\n4. **Three-Color Technicolor**: The major breakthrough came with the introduction of the three-color Technicolor process in the 1930s. This process allowed for more vibrant and realistic colors.\n\n5. **First Major Color Feature Film**: The first major feature film to use the three-color Technicolor process was \"Becky Sharp,\" released in 1935.\n\n6. **Widespread Adoption**: The use of color in films became more common in the late 1930s and 1940s. A landmark film that showcased the potential of color was \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), which is famous for its use of color.\n\n7. **Post-War Era**: After World War II, color films became increasingly popular, and by the 1960s, color was the standard for most films.\n\nIn summary, while early experiments with color films began in the early 1900s, the widespread use of color in movies started with the introduction of the three-color Technicolor process in the 1930s, with significant films like \"Becky Sharp\" (1935) and \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) marking important milestones."}
