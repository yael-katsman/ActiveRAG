{"question": "Which 'literary' nickname has been given to the extinct species of man, discovered in Indonesia 2003, named Homo Floresiensis?", "chain_of_thought_result": "The extinct species of man discovered in Indonesia in 2003, known as Homo floresiensis, has been given the literary nickname \"Hobbit.\" This nickname is derived from the small stature of the species, which is reminiscent of the hobbits from J.R.R. Tolkien's literary works. Homo floresiensis was notably small, standing about 3.5 feet tall, which contributed to this whimsical comparison."}
