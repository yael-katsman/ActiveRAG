{"question": "Who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War?", "chain_of_thought_result": "The individual expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War was Andr\u00e9 Breton. He was a leading figure in the Surrealist movement, but his support for the Communist Party and his stance on the Spanish Civil War led to conflicts with other members of the movement, particularly with those who held different political views. Ultimately, his expulsion was a result of these ideological differences."}
