{"question": "Approximately how many years old is the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine the approximate age of the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the formation of the Great Barrier Reef**: The Great Barrier Reef is primarily made up of coral reefs, which are formed by the accumulation of coral polyps over time.\n\n2. **Understand coral growth rates**: Coral reefs grow at varying rates depending on species and environmental conditions, but on average, they can grow about 1 to 3 centimeters per year.\n\n3. **Estimate the age of the living corals**: The living part of the Great Barrier Reef is primarily composed of corals that have been growing for thousands of years. The oldest sections of the reef are estimated to be around 6,000 to 8,000 years old.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef is approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years old.\n\nFinal Answer: Approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years old."}
