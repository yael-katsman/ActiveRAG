{"question": "Isoprene, Butyl and Nitrile are all types of which substance?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the substances mentioned**: The question lists three substances: Isoprene, Butyl, and Nitrile.\n\n2. **Research each substance**:\n   - **Isoprene**: This is a hydrocarbon that is a building block for natural rubber and synthetic rubber. It is a diene, meaning it has two double bonds.\n   - **Butyl**: This typically refers to butyl rubber, which is a synthetic rubber made from isobutylene and isoprene. It is known for its impermeability to gases.\n   - **Nitrile**: This refers to nitrile rubber, which is made from the polymerization of acrylonitrile and butadiene. It is known for its resistance to oils and chemicals.\n\n3. **Determine the commonality**: All three substances are types of polymers or materials used in the production of synthetic rubber.\n\n4. **Conclude the answer**: Isoprene, Butyl, and Nitrile are all types of **rubber** or **synthetic rubber**. \n\nFinal Answer: Rubber (or synthetic rubber)."}
