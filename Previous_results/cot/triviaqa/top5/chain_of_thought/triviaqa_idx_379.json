{"question": "How many faces has an icosahedron?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine how many faces an icosahedron has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define an icosahedron**: An icosahedron is a type of polyhedron that is characterized by its geometric properties.\n\n2. **Identify the shape**: An icosahedron is specifically a convex polyhedron with triangular faces.\n\n3. **Count the faces**: By definition, a regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the number of faces on an icosahedron is 20.\n\nAnswer: 20 faces."}
