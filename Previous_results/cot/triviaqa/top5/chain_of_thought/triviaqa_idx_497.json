{"question": "How many balls are on a snooker table at the beginning of a game?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine how many balls are on a snooker table at the beginning of a game, we need to consider the types of balls used in snooker:\n\n1. **Red Balls**: There are 15 red balls on the table.\n2. **Colored Balls**: There are 6 colored balls (yellow, green, brown, blue, pink, and black).\n\nNow, we add these together:\n\n- Red balls: 15\n- Colored balls: 6\n\nTotal number of balls = 15 (red) + 6 (colored) = 21 balls.\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of a game of snooker, there are **21 balls** on the table."}
