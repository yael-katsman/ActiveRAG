{"question": "How many legs (including arms or pincers according to certain definitions) does a crab have?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine how many legs a crab has, we can break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Crab Anatomy**: Crabs are crustaceans, and their anatomy includes various appendages.\n\n2. **Counting the Legs**: \n   - Crabs typically have 10 limbs in total. This includes:\n     - 8 walking legs (4 pairs).\n     - 2 pincers (chelae), which are often considered modified legs.\n\n3. **Total Count**: \n   - If we include the pincers as legs, we add them to the 8 walking legs.\n   - Therefore, 8 (walking legs) + 2 (pincers) = 10 legs in total.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - According to the definition that includes pincers as legs, a crab has 10 legs.\n\nSo, the answer is: **10 legs**."}
