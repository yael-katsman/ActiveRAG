{"question": "When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?", "chain_of_thought_result": "When the egg is released from the ovary during ovulation, what is left behind is a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum forms from the follicle that housed the egg. After the egg is released, the follicle transforms into this temporary endocrine gland, which produces hormones, primarily progesterone, to help prepare the uterine lining for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum eventually degenerates, leading to a decrease in hormone levels and the onset of menstruation."}
