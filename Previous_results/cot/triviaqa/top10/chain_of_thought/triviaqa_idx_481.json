{"question": "When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?", "chain_of_thought_result": "When the egg is released from the ovary during the process of ovulation, what is left behind is primarily the structure known as the corpus luteum. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Follicle Development**: Before ovulation, the egg (oocyte) develops within a follicle in the ovary. As the follicle matures, it prepares to release the egg.\n\n2. **Ovulation**: During ovulation, the mature follicle ruptures, releasing the egg into the fallopian tube.\n\n3. **Formation of Corpus Luteum**: After the egg is released, the remaining follicular cells transform into a structure called the corpus luteum. This structure is crucial for hormone production.\n\n4. **Hormone Production**: The corpus luteum produces hormones, primarily progesterone and some estrogen, which are essential for maintaining the uterine lining in case of pregnancy.\n\n5. **If No Pregnancy Occurs**: If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum eventually degenerates into a scar-like structure called the corpus albicans.\n\nIn summary, when the egg is released from the ovary, the corpus luteum is left behind, which plays a vital role in the menstrual cycle and potential pregnancy."}
