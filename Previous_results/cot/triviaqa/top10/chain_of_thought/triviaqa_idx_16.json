{"question": "Composite, Shield and Cinder Cone are all types of what?", "chain_of_thought_result": "Composite, Shield, and Cinder Cone are all types of volcanoes. \n\n1. **Composite Volcanoes**: Also known as stratovolcanoes, these are characterized by their steep profiles and are formed from alternating layers of lava flow, ash, and other volcanic debris. They typically produce explosive eruptions.\n\n2. **Shield Volcanoes**: These have a broad, gently sloping shape and are primarily built up by the flow of low-viscosity lava that can travel long distances. They generally have non-explosive eruptions.\n\n3. **Cinder Cone Volcanoes**: These are the simplest type of volcano, formed from the accumulation of volcanic debris such as ash and cinders around a single vent. They usually have steep slopes and are often smaller than the other types.\n\nIn summary, all three are classifications of volcanoes based on their shape, eruption style, and the materials they are composed of."}
