These riots were a series of violent confrontations between the police and the local community in Brixton, South London, primarily sparked by tensions related to policing practices, racial discrimination, and social issues. The Scarman report, published later in 1981, investigated the causes of the riots and made recommendations for improving community relations and policing in the area."}
