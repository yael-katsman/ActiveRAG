{"question": "How many faces has an icosahedron?", "chain_of_thought_result": "An icosahedron is a type of polyhedron that is characterized by its geometric properties. To determine how many faces it has, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Definition of an Icosahedron**: An icosahedron is a three-dimensional shape that is one of the five Platonic solids.\n\n2. **Characteristics of Platonic Solids**: Platonic solids are convex polyhedra with identical faces composed of congruent convex regular polygons. There are five types of Platonic solids: tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.\n\n3. **Specifics of the Icosahedron**: The icosahedron specifically has triangular faces. \n\n4. **Counting the Faces**: An icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that an icosahedron has **20 faces**."}
