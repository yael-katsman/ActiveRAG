{"question": "Approximately how many years old is the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To determine the approximate age of the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Coral Growth**: Coral reefs are built by tiny marine animals called corals. These corals grow slowly, typically at a rate of about 1 to 3 centimeters per year.\n\n2. **Age of the Great Barrier Reef**: The Great Barrier Reef itself is much older than the living corals. The reef structure has been forming for thousands of years. The current living corals are part of a larger reef system that has been developing for around 20,000 to 30,000 years.\n\n3. **Living Coral Age**: The living corals that make up the Great Barrier Reef are generally younger than the reef structure itself. Most of the living coral is estimated to be around 5,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef is approximately 5,000 to 10,000 years old.\n\nFinal Answer: Approximately 5,000 to 10,000 years old."}
