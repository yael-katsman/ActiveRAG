{"question": "The Futhark is what type of alphabet?", "chain_of_thought_result": "The Futhark is a runic alphabet used by the Germanic peoples, particularly in Scandinavia and the British Isles, from around the 2nd to the 8th centuries AD. It is primarily associated with the early Germanic languages and is known for its angular characters, which were well-suited for carving into wood or stone. The name \"Futhark\" comes from the first six letters of the alphabet: F, U, \u00de (thorn), A, R, and K. There are different versions of the Futhark, including the Elder Futhark and the Younger Futhark, each with variations in the number of characters and their usage."}
