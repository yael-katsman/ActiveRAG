{"question": "Five ninths of three fifths is a?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To find \"five ninths of three fifths,\" we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the fractions to their numerical values**:\n   - Five ninths is represented as \\( \\frac{5}{9} \\).\n   - Three fifths is represented as \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\).\n\n2. **Multiply the two fractions**:\n   To multiply fractions, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5}{9} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{9 \\times 5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the numerator and denominator**:\n   - The numerator: \\( 5 \\times 3 = 15 \\)\n   - The denominator: \\( 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\)\n\n   So, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15}{45}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   To simplify \\( \\frac{15}{45} \\), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15 \\div 15}{45 \\div 15} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, five ninths of three fifths is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)"}
