{"question": "Isoprene, Butyl and Nitrile are all types of which substance?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the substances mentioned**: The question lists three substances: Isoprene, Butyl, and Nitrile.\n\n2. **Research each substance**:\n   - **Isoprene**: This is a natural compound that is a building block for many types of synthetic rubber and is also found in natural rubber.\n   - **Butyl**: This typically refers to butyl rubber, which is a type of synthetic rubber made from isobutylene and isoprene.\n   - **Nitrile**: This refers to nitrile rubber, which is a synthetic rubber made from the copolymerization of acrylonitrile and butadiene.\n\n3. **Determine the common category**: All three substances (Isoprene, Butyl, and Nitrile) are related to rubber. Isoprene is a monomer used to produce natural rubber and synthetic rubber, Butyl is a type of synthetic rubber, and Nitrile is another type of synthetic rubber.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since all three are associated with rubber production and types, the answer to the question is:\n\n**Answer**: Rubber (specifically types of synthetic rubber)."}
