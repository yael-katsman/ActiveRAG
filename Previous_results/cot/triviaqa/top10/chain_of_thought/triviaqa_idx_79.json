{"question": "What was disestablished as the state religion of Japan after WWII?", "chain_of_thought_result": "After World War II, Shinto was disestablished as the state religion of Japan. The Allied Occupation authorities, led by the United States, implemented reforms that separated religion from the state, which included the removal of Shinto's status as the state religion. This was formalized in the new constitution adopted in 1947, which guaranteed freedom of religion and prohibited the government from promoting or endorsing any religion."}
