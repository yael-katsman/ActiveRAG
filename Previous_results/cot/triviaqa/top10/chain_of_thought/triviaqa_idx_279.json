{"question": "Which Swedish actress won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Murder on the Orient Express?", "chain_of_thought_result": "To answer the question step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the film mentioned: \"Murder on the Orient Express.\"\n2. Determine the year the film was released: The most notable adaptation was released in 2017.\n3. Check the nominees and winners for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for that year: The 90th Academy Awards took place in 2018.\n4. Identify the winner of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for that year: The award was won by Allison Janney for her role in \"I, Tonya.\"\n5. However, the question specifically asks for a Swedish actress. The notable Swedish actress in \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is Michelle Pfeiffer, but she is not Swedish.\n6. The Swedish actress who was nominated for her role in \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is Daisy Ridley, but she is not Swedish either.\n7. The Swedish actress who actually won the Oscar for a role in a film related to Agatha Christie is Ingrid Bergman, but she won for \"Murder on the Orient Express\" in 1974, not the 2017 version.\n\nAfter considering all these points, it appears that the question may be misleading, as no Swedish actress won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar specifically for the 2017 \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" The answer is:\n\n**Ingrid Bergman** (for the 1974 version of \"Murder on the Orient Express\")."}
