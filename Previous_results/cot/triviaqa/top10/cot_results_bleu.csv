1,"To find ""five ninths of three fifths,"" we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the fractions to their numerical values**:
   - Five ninths is represented as \( \frac{5}{9} \).
   - Three fifths is represented as \( \frac{3}{5} \).

2. **Multiply the two fractions**:
   To multiply fractions, you multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
   \[
   \frac{5}{9} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{5 \times 3}{9 \times 5}
   \]

3. **Calculate the numerator and denominator**:
   - The numerator: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
   - The denominator: \( 9 \times 5 = 45 \)

   So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{15}{45}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction**:
   To simplify \( \frac{15}{45} \), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:
   \[
   \frac{15 \div 15}{45 \div 15} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, five ninths of three fifths is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

   - 6th string (E) - low E
   - 5th string (A)
   - 4th string (D)
   - 3rd string (G)

1. **Identify the Context**: The question is about Thomas Cromwell, a key figure in the court of King Henry VIII of England.

2. **Understand the Historical Background**: Thomas Cromwell was a statesman who served as chief minister to Henry VIII. He played a significant role in the English Reformation and the dissolution of the monasteries.

1. **Understand the units**: 
   - A UK ton (also known as a long ton) is equal to 1,016 kilograms.
   - A hundredweight (cwt) in the UK is defined as 112 pounds.

2. **Convert UK ton to pounds**:
   - Since 1 UK ton = 1,016 kg, we need to convert kilograms to pounds. 
   - The conversion factor is approximately 1 kg = 2.20462 pounds.
   - Therefore, 1,016 kg = 1,016 * 2.20462 pounds ≈ 2,243.2 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of hundredweights**:
   - Since 1 hundredweight (cwt) = 112 pounds, we can find the number of hundredweights in a UK ton by dividing the total pounds by the number of pounds in a hundredweight.
   - So, 2,243.2 pounds ÷ 112 pounds/cwt ≈ 20.0 cwt.

371,"To answer the question about how certain religions divide the notion of heaven into parts, we can break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Concept of Heaven**: In many religions, heaven is viewed as a place of eternal bliss, reward, or communion with the divine. However, interpretations and descriptions of heaven can vary significantly.

2. **Identifying Religions with Divided Concepts of Heaven**: Several religions have specific beliefs about different levels or types of heaven. For example:
   - **Christianity**: Some denominations believe in different levels of heaven or rewards based on one's faith and actions (e.g., the concept of the ""New Jerusalem"" or varying degrees of glory in the afterlife).
   - **Islam**: The Quran describes Jannah (paradise) as having multiple levels, with the highest being reserved for the most righteous.
   - **Hinduism**: Swarga is considered a temporary heaven where souls enjoy the fruits of their good deeds before reincarnation, and there are various realms of existence.
   - **Buddhism**: While not a heaven in the traditional sense, there are various heavenly realms (deva realms) where beings experience bliss based on their karma.

3. **General Divisions of Heaven**: In these religions, heaven can often be divided into parts based on criteria such as:
   - **Moral or Spiritual Worthiness**: Levels may be assigned based on one's actions, faith, or adherence to religious teachings.
   - **Duration of Stay**: Some heavens are temporary (like in Hinduism) while others are eternal.
   - **Type of Experience**: Different heavens may offer varying experiences of bliss, communion, or enlightenment.

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the answer to the question is that certain religions generally divide the notion of heaven into parts based on moral worthiness, duration of stay, and type of experience.

481,"When the egg is released from the ovary during the process of ovulation, what is left behind is primarily the structure known as the corpus luteum. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Follicle Development**: Before ovulation, the egg (oocyte) develops within a follicle in the ovary. As the follicle matures, it prepares to release the egg.

2. **Ovulation**: During ovulation, the mature follicle ruptures, releasing the egg into the fallopian tube.

3. **Formation of Corpus Luteum**: After the egg is released, the remaining follicular cells transform into a structure called the corpus luteum. This structure is crucial for hormone production.

4. **Hormone Production**: The corpus luteum produces hormones, primarily progesterone and some estrogen, which are essential for maintaining the uterine lining in case of pregnancy.

5. **If No Pregnancy Occurs**: If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum eventually degenerates into a scar-like structure called the corpus albicans.
