{"question": "When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?", "api_result": "When an egg is released from the ovary during the process of ovulation, the structure that remains behind is called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is formed from the follicle that housed the egg. After ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes hormones, primarily progesterone and some estrogen, which are important for maintaining the uterine lining in preparation for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum eventually degenerates, leading to a decrease in hormone levels and the onset of menstruation."}
