{"question": "The Futhark is what type of alphabet?", "api_result": "The Futhark is a runic alphabet used by Germanic tribes, particularly in Scandinavia and the British Isles, from around the 2nd to the 8th centuries. It is characterized by its angular shapes, which were well-suited for carving into wood, stone, and metal. The name \"Futhark\" comes from the first six letters of the alphabet: F, U, \u00de (thorn), A, R, and K. There are different versions of the Futhark, including the Elder Futhark, which is the oldest form, and the Younger Futhark, which evolved later."}
