{"question": "From which country do French fries originate? France, Belgium or Switzerland?", "api_result": "French fries are believed to have originated in Belgium. The story goes that Belgian villagers were frying potatoes in the late 1600s, and the dish became popular. While they are called \"French fries\" in many countries, particularly in the United States, the name is thought to have come from the American soldiers who encountered the dish in Belgium during World War I and mistakenly attributed it to France. So, the correct answer is Belgium."}
