{"question": "Who were the notorious Friars of St Francis of Wycombe?", "api_result": "The Friars of St. Francis of Wycombe, also known as the Franciscan Friars of Wycombe, were a group of Franciscan monks who were active in the town of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England, during the late medieval period. They were part of the broader Franciscan order, which was founded by St. Francis of Assisi in the early 13th century and emphasized a life of poverty, humility, and service to the poor.\n\nThe Wycombe friars were known for their charitable works and their commitment to the community. They played a significant role in local religious life and were involved in various social and educational activities. However, the term \"notorious\" may not accurately describe them in a historical context, as they were generally respected figures within their community.\n\nThe friary in High Wycombe was established in the 13th century and served as a center for the Franciscan mission in the area until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century under King Henry VIII. After the dissolution, the friary was closed, and its properties were seized by the crown.\n\nIf you are looking for specific incidents or characteristics that led to their notoriety, please provide more context, as the term \"notorious\" could imply a range of interpretations."}
