{"question": "Who was expelled from the Surrealist movement due to his views on the Spanish Civil War?", "api_result": "Andr\u00e9 Breton, the founder of the Surrealist movement, expelled the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed from the movement in 1939. This expulsion was largely due to Dal\u00ed's perceived indifference to the Spanish Civil War and his controversial political views, which clashed with the movement's leftist ideals. Dal\u00ed's actions and statements during this period were seen as a betrayal by Breton and other Surrealists, leading to his exclusion from the group."}
