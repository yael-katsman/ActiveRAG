{"question": "What the note is at the 12th fret of the 1st and 6th strings of a standard-tuned 6-string guitar?", "api_result": "In standard tuning, the 1st string (high E) and the 6th string (low E) of a 6-string guitar are tuned as follows:\n\n- 1st string (high E): E\n- 6th string (low E): E\n\nAt the 12th fret, both strings are one octave higher than their open string notes. Therefore:\n\n- The note at the 12th fret of the 1st string (high E) is E.\n- The note at the 12th fret of the 6th string (low E) is also E.\n\nSo, the note at the 12th fret of both the 1st and 6th strings is E."}
