{"question": "Isoprene, Butyl and Nitrile are all types of which substance?", "api_result": "Isoprene, butyl, and nitrile are all types of **rubber** or **elastomers**. Specifically, isoprene is a monomer used to produce natural rubber (polyisoprene), butyl rubber is a synthetic rubber made from isobutylene and isoprene, and nitrile rubber (NBR) is a synthetic rubber made from acrylonitrile and butadiene. These materials are commonly used in various applications due to their elasticity and durability."}
