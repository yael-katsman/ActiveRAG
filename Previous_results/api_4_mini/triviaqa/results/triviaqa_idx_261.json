{"question": "Who first identified and isolated nucleic acids, the precursor to identifying DNA?", "api_result": "Nucleic acids were first identified and isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. He discovered a substance he called \"nuclein\" while studying the composition of cell nuclei, which was later understood to be DNA. Miescher's work laid the foundation for the subsequent identification and understanding of DNA as the genetic material."}
