{"question": "Which international treaties of 1899 and 1907 cover the use of weapons in war?", "api_result": "The international treaties of 1899 and 1907 that cover the use of weapons in war are known as the **Hague Conventions**. \n\n1. **Hague Convention of 1899**: This was the first international agreement to regulate the conduct of warfare. It included provisions on the laws and customs of war, the treatment of prisoners of war, and the protection of civilians. It also addressed the use of certain types of weapons and prohibited the use of projectiles that are solely intended to cause unnecessary suffering.\n\n2. **Hague Convention of 1907**: This expanded upon the earlier convention and included additional regulations regarding the conduct of hostilities, the treatment of prisoners, and the rights of neutral parties. It reaffirmed many of the principles established in the 1899 convention and introduced further rules regarding the use of weapons and the conduct of armed forces.\n\nBoth conventions laid the groundwork for modern international humanitarian law and continue to influence the laws of armed conflict today."}
