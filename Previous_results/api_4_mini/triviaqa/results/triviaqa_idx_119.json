{"question": "A frugivore feeds on what?", "api_result": "A frugivore primarily feeds on fruits. These animals have adaptations that allow them to consume and digest fruit, which is often high in sugars and nutrients. Frugivores play a crucial role in ecosystems by aiding in seed dispersal, as they often consume fruits and then excrete the seeds in different locations. Examples of frugivores include many species of birds, bats, and some primates."}
