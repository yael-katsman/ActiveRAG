{"question": "What does an octopus spray when threatened?", "api_result": "When threatened, an octopus can spray a cloud of ink. This ink serves as a defense mechanism, creating a smokescreen that allows the octopus to escape from predators. The ink can also contain substances that may irritate the predator's eyes or mask the octopus's scent, further aiding in its escape."}
