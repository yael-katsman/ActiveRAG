{"question": "What was the name of Sir Fred Hoyles theory, an alternative to the Big Bang, that said that there was continuous creation of matter between galaxies, so that as galaxies get further apart, new ones develop between them?", "api_result": "Sir Fred Hoyle's theory is known as the \"Steady State Theory.\" This theory proposed that the universe is eternal and unchanging on a large scale, with matter being continuously created to maintain a constant density as galaxies move apart. This was an alternative to the Big Bang theory, which suggests that the universe had a beginning and has been expanding ever since."}
