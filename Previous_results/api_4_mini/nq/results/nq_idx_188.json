{"question": "who came up with popcorn at the movies", "api_result": "Popcorn became popular in movie theaters during the Great Depression in the 1930s. While it\u2019s difficult to attribute the idea of selling popcorn at the movies to a single individual, it is widely recognized that the combination of affordable popcorn and the growing popularity of cinema helped to establish it as a staple snack in theaters. \n\nBefore this time, popcorn was already a popular snack in the United States, often sold at fairs and circuses. The introduction of popcorn machines made it easier to prepare and sell popcorn in theaters. One of the key figures in popularizing popcorn in movie theaters was a man named Charles Cretors, who invented the first commercial popcorn machine in the late 19th century. His invention made it feasible for theaters to sell popcorn, and by the 1930s, it became a common sight in cinemas across the country. \n\nSo, while there isn't a single person who \"came up\" with popcorn at the movies, it was a combination of technological innovation and changing social habits that led to its popularity in theaters."}
