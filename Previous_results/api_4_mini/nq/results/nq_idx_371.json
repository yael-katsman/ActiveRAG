{"question": "how long do former presidents get secret service protection", "api_result": "Former U.S. presidents are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. However, this was not always the case. In 1994, Congress passed a law that restored lifetime Secret Service protection for all former presidents. Prior to that, protection was limited to 10 years after leaving office, a policy that was established in 1996. The law applies to all former presidents who served after the law was enacted, while those who served before may still have lifetime protection depending on their circumstances."}
