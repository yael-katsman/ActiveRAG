{"question": "where is the tablet of the ten commandments", "api_result": "The location of the original tablets of the Ten Commandments, according to biblical tradition, is not definitively known. According to the Hebrew Bible, Moses received the tablets on Mount Sinai. Afterward, they were placed in the Ark of the Covenant, a sacred container that was built to hold the tablets and other holy items. \n\nThe Ark of the Covenant itself is said to have been housed in the Tabernacle during the Israelites' wanderings in the desert and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. However, the fate of the Ark and the tablets is unclear, as they are not mentioned in historical records after the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in the 6th century BCE. Many believe that the Ark was lost or hidden, and its exact location remains a mystery. Various theories and legends exist regarding its whereabouts, but none have been substantiated."}
