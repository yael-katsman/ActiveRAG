{"question": "when did they stop saying mass in latin", "api_result": "The use of Latin in the Roman Catholic Mass began to decline after the Second Vatican Council, which took place from 1962 to 1965. The council's document \"Sacrosanctum Concilium,\" issued in 1963, encouraged the use of vernacular languages in the liturgy to make it more accessible to the laity. The transition to the use of local languages in the Mass began in earnest in the late 1960s, with the first vernacular translations of the Mass being introduced in various countries around that time. By the early 1970s, the Mass was predominantly celebrated in the vernacular rather than in Latin. However, Latin is still used in some contexts within the Catholic Church, including certain traditional Masses and ceremonies."}
