{"question": "what allows chyme to enter the small intestine", "api_result": "Chyme, which is the semi-liquid mass of partially digested food, enters the small intestine through a structure called the pyloric sphincter. The pyloric sphincter is a muscular valve located at the junction between the stomach and the small intestine (specifically, the duodenum). It regulates the passage of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine, allowing small amounts of chyme to be released at a time. This controlled release is important for proper digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine."}
