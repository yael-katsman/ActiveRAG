{"question": "how many co2 molecules are produced in aerobic respiration", "api_result": "In aerobic respiration, one molecule of glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086) is completely oxidized to produce carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and water (H\u2082O). The overall balanced equation for aerobic respiration is:\n\n\\[ \nC\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6 O\u2082 \\rightarrow 6 CO\u2082 + 6 H\u2082O \n\\]\n\nFrom this equation, you can see that for each molecule of glucose that is metabolized, 6 molecules of carbon dioxide are produced. Therefore, during aerobic respiration, 6 CO\u2082 molecules are generated for each molecule of glucose consumed."}
