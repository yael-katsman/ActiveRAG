{"question": "is parallax more pronounced with nearby stars or with distant stars", "api_result": "Parallax is more pronounced with nearby stars. The parallax effect refers to the apparent shift in position of an object when viewed from different locations. For stars, this shift is observed as the Earth orbits the Sun. \n\nThe closer a star is to Earth, the greater the angle of its apparent shift against the background of more distant stars. This is because the baseline (the distance between the two observation points, in this case, the Earth's position at different times of the year) is relatively large compared to the distance to nearby stars. In contrast, distant stars exhibit a much smaller parallax shift because their distance is so great that the angle of apparent movement is minimal. \n\nThus, parallax measurements are most effective for determining the distances to stars that are relatively close to us, typically within a few hundred light-years."}
