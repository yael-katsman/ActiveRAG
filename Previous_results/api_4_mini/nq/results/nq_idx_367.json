{"question": "what information is displayed in clear text from the ftp header", "api_result": "When you connect to an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server, the FTP header typically includes several pieces of information that are displayed in clear text. This information can include:\n\n1. **FTP Server Version**: The version of the FTP server software that is running.\n\n2. **Server Greeting Message**: A welcome message from the server, which may include the server's name, version, and sometimes additional information about the server.\n\n3. **Supported Commands**: Some servers may provide a list of commands that they support, which can be useful for clients to understand what operations can be performed.\n\n4. **Connection Information**: Information about the connection, such as the protocol being used (e.g., FTP, FTPS) and the type of connection (active or passive).\n\n5. **User Authentication Requirements**: The server may indicate whether it requires a username and password for access.\n\n6. **Current Directory**: After logging in, the server may display the current working directory.\n\n7. **File Listings**: When listing files in a directory, the server sends information about the files, including names, sizes, and timestamps.\n\n8. **Status Codes and Messages**: The server communicates status codes (like 200, 220, 530, etc.) along with messages that indicate the result of commands issued by the client.\n\nSince FTP transmits data in clear text, this information can be intercepted by anyone monitoring the network traffic, which is one of the reasons why secure alternatives like SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP Secure) are recommended for sensitive data transfers."}
