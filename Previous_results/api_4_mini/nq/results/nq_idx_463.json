{"question": "when was the last time mount ruapehu erupted", "api_result": "Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand last erupted on September 25, 2007. This eruption was a phreatic eruption, which occurs when water beneath the ground is heated by magma, leading to steam explosions. Since then, there have been signs of volcanic activity, but no significant eruptions have occurred. For the most current information, it's always best to check with geological monitoring agencies."}
