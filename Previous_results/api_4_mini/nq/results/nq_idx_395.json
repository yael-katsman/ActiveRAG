{"question": "when did the three little pigs come out", "api_result": "The story of \"The Three Little Pigs\" is a traditional folk tale that has been passed down through generations, and its exact origins are difficult to pinpoint. The earliest known published version of the story appeared in England in the late 19th century, specifically in 1890 in a collection of stories by Joseph Jacobs titled \"English Fairy Tales.\" However, variations of the tale likely existed in oral tradition long before that."}
