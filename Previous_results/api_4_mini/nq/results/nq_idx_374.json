{"question": "when did the nba start playing zone defense", "api_result": "The NBA officially allowed zone defense starting in the 2001-2002 season. Prior to that, the league primarily enforced a rule that required teams to play man-to-man defense, with some restrictions on zone defenses. The change allowed teams to implement more varied defensive strategies, leading to a shift in how the game was played."}
