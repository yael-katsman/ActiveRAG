{"question": "what process causes the continents to drift apart how", "api_result": "The process that causes continents to drift apart is known as **plate tectonics**. This theory explains the movement of the Earth's lithosphere, which is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. Here\u2019s how the process works:\n\n1. **Convection Currents**: The heat from the Earth's core causes convection currents in the mantle. Hot, less dense material rises, while cooler, denser material sinks. This movement creates a flow that can push the tectonic plates in different directions.\n\n2. **Divergent Boundaries**: At divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move away from each other. This often occurs at mid-ocean ridges, where magma rises from the mantle to create new oceanic crust. As the new crust forms, it pushes the older crust away from the ridge, causing the continents on either side to drift apart.\n\n3. **Continental Drift**: The concept of continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century, suggests that continents were once part of a single supercontinent called Pangaea. Over millions of years, Pangaea broke apart, and the continents have been drifting to their current positions.\n\n4. **Subduction Zones**: At convergent boundaries, where plates collide, one plate may be forced beneath another in a process called subduction. This can lead to the recycling of crust and can also influence the movement of adjacent plates.\n\n5. **Transform Boundaries**: At transform boundaries, plates slide past each other horizontally. This lateral movement can also contribute to the shifting of continents over time.\n\nOverall, the movement of tectonic plates is a slow but continuous process that shapes the Earth's surface, leading to the drifting of continents over geological time scales."}
