{"question": "where did the butchers in the slaughterhouse cases live", "api_result": "In the context of the \"Slaughterhouse Cases,\" which were a series of Supreme Court cases decided in 1873, the butchers involved primarily lived in New Orleans, Louisiana. The cases arose from a Louisiana law that granted a monopoly to a single slaughterhouse in the city, which led to significant legal challenges from other butchers who argued that this law violated their rights under the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court's decision in these cases had a lasting impact on the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and the rights of individuals versus state regulations."}
