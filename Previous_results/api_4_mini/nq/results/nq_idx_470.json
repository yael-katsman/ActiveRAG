{"question": "what is loihi and where does it originate from", "api_result": "Loihi is an underwater volcano located off the southeastern coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. It is part of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain and is considered to be the newest volcano in the Hawaiian archipelago. Loihi is currently an active volcano, and it is situated about 3,200 feet (approximately 975 meters) below sea level.\n\nLoihi originates from the Hawaiian hotspot, a volcanic hotspot that has been responsible for the formation of the Hawaiian Islands over millions of years. As the Pacific tectonic plate moves over this hotspot, magma rises to the surface, creating volcanic islands. Loihi is still in the early stages of its development and is expected to eventually rise above sea level, potentially becoming a new island in the future. However, this process will take thousands to millions of years."}
