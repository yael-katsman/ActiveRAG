{"question": "what does a yellow 35 mph sign mean", "api_result": "A yellow 35 mph sign indicates that the recommended speed limit for that particular area is 35 miles per hour. This sign is often used in areas where the speed limit may change due to conditions such as curves, intersections, or other factors that could affect safe driving. It's important to note that while yellow signs are advisory, they are not legally enforceable speed limits like regulatory signs (which are typically white). Drivers should use their judgment and adjust their speed according to road conditions and safety."}
