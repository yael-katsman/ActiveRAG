{"question": "what does the adrenal gland produce that is necessary for the sympathetic nervous system to function", "api_result": "The adrenal gland produces several hormones that are crucial for the functioning of the sympathetic nervous system, particularly catecholamines such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and norepinephrine. These hormones are released into the bloodstream in response to stress or danger, preparing the body for a \"fight or flight\" response. They increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, and enhance energy availability, among other effects, thereby supporting the actions of the sympathetic nervous system."}
