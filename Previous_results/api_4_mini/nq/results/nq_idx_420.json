{"question": "chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts", "api_result": "The chemicals produced in one part of a plant that affect the growth and response of other parts are known as **hormones** or **plant growth regulators**. These hormones play crucial roles in regulating various physiological processes, including growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. Some of the key plant hormones include:\n\n1. **Auxins** - Promote cell elongation and are involved in processes such as phototropism (growth towards light) and gravitropism (growth in response to gravity).\n\n2. **Gibberellins** - Stimulate stem elongation, seed germination, and flowering.\n\n3. **Cytokinins** - Promote cell division and can influence shoot and root growth.\n\n4. **Abscisic Acid (ABA)** - Often associated with stress responses, it helps regulate water loss and seed dormancy.\n\n5. **Ethylene** - A gaseous hormone that influences fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf fall.\n\nThese hormones can be produced in various parts of the plant, such as roots, stems, and leaves, and they can travel to other parts to exert their effects, coordinating growth and development throughout the plant."}
