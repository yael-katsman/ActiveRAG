{"question": "what percentage of the us population lives below the poverty line", "api_result": "As of my last update in October 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that approximately 11.4% of the U.S. population lived below the poverty line in 2020. However, this percentage can fluctuate annually based on economic conditions, policy changes, and other factors.
