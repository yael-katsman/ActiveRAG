{"question": "when does the world cup of hockey start", "api_result": "The World Cup of Hockey was last held in 2016, and as of my last update in October 2023, there hasn't been a confirmed date for the next tournament. The event is typically organized by the NHL and the NHL Players' Association, and there have been discussions about a potential future tournament. For the most current information, I recommend checking the official NHL website or other reliable sports news sources."}
