{"question": "where does blood go when it leaves the pulmonary artery", "api_result": "When blood leaves the pulmonary artery, it is directed towards the lungs. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. In the lungs, the blood travels through smaller branches of the pulmonary artery, eventually reaching the pulmonary capillaries surrounding the alveoli (air sacs). Here, the blood releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen, becoming oxygenated. After this gas exchange, the oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium."}
