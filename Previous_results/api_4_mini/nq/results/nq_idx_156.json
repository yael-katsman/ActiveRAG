{"question": "who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition", "api_result": "The composer who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system is Arnold Schoenberg. He developed this method in the early 20th century as a way to organize pitch in a systematic manner, moving away from the tonal structures that had dominated Western music for centuries. The twelve-tone technique involves using all twelve notes of the chromatic scale in a specific order, known as a \"tone row,\" which serves as the basis for a composition."}
