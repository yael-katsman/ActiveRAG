{"question": "when did movies start coming out in color", "api_result": "Movies began to be produced in color in the early 20th century, but the process was not widely adopted until later. The first successful color process was Kinemacolor, which was introduced in 1908. However, it wasn't until the 1930s that color films became more common. \n\nOne of the first feature-length films to be made entirely in color was \"Becky Sharp,\" released in 1935. The introduction of Technicolor, particularly the three-color process in the 1930s, significantly advanced the quality and appeal of color films. A landmark film that showcased this technology was \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" in 1938. \n\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, color films became the standard in the industry, and black-and-white films became less common. Today, most films are produced in color, although black-and-white films are still made for artistic reasons."}
