{"question": "when did they stop using aluminum wiring in ontario", "api_result": "Aluminum wiring was commonly used in residential construction in Ontario and other parts of North America from the late 1960s until the early 1970s. However, due to safety concerns related to its tendency to expand and contract, which can lead to loose connections and increased fire risk, its use began to decline. By the mid-1970s, the Canadian Electrical Code started to impose stricter regulations, and the use of aluminum wiring in new residential construction largely ceased. If you are dealing with a property that may have aluminum wiring, it is advisable to have it inspected by a qualified electrician to ensure safety."}
