{"question": "when did ireland gain its independence from england", "api_result": "Ireland gained its independence from England in stages. The most significant event was the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was signed on December 6, 1921, and came into effect on January 1, 1922. This treaty established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth. However, it wasn't until 1949 that Ireland became a republic and fully severed its ties with the British Commonwealth."}
