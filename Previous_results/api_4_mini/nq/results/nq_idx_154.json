{"question": "who led the soldiers in ending the raid on the harper's ferry arsenal", "api_result": "The raid on the Harpers Ferry arsenal in 1859 was led by John Brown, an abolitionist who aimed to initiate an armed slave revolt by capturing the arsenal and distributing weapons to enslaved people. However, the raid was quickly suppressed by local militia and U.S. Marines, led by Colonel Robert E. Lee, who was in command of the federal forces that responded to the situation. Lee's troops successfully captured Brown and his followers, leading to their trial and execution."}
