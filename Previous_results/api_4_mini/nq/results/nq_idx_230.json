{"question": "when do primary ossification centers appear in an embryo", "api_result": "Primary ossification centers typically begin to appear in an embryo around the 7th to 12th week of gestation. The process of ossification starts in the long bones and other skeletal structures, with the primary ossification centers forming in the diaphysis (the shaft) of the bones. This process is part of the overall development of the skeletal system, which continues to evolve throughout fetal development and into early childhood."}
