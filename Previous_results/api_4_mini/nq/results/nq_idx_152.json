{"question": "where does the sun hit the us first", "api_result": "The first place in the United States to see the sunrise is generally considered to be the easternmost point of the country, which is located in the state of Alaska. Specifically, the island of Semisopochnoi in the Aleutian Islands is the first landmass to experience sunrise due to the way the International Date Line is drawn. However, if considering the contiguous United States, the first place to see the sunrise is typically Acadia National Park in Maine."}
