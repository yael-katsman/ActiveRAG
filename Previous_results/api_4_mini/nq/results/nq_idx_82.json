{"question": "when was fingerprinting first used by the police", "api_result": "Fingerprinting was first used by the police in the late 19th century. The first systematic use of fingerprints for criminal identification is attributed to Sir Edward Henry in 1897 in England. However, the practice of using fingerprints for identification dates back even earlier, with some evidence of their use in ancient Babylon and by the Chinese. The modern forensic application of fingerprinting began to take shape in the late 1800s, leading to its adoption by police forces around the world."}
