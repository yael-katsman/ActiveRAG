{"question": "what is the snow on mars made of", "api_result": "The snow on Mars is primarily made of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice, commonly referred to as \"dry ice.\" During the Martian winter, temperatures can drop low enough for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to freeze and fall as snow. In some regions, particularly at the poles, water ice can also be present, but the snow that falls in most areas of Mars is predominantly CO2 ice. Additionally, there are seasonal frost deposits that can form from both carbon dioxide and water ice, depending on the local conditions."}
