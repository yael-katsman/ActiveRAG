{"question": "what type of fuel goes in a zippo", "api_result": "A Zippo lighter typically uses lighter fluid, which is a type of refined petroleum product. The most common fuel for Zippo lighters is naphtha, a volatile liquid hydrocarbon mixture. Zippo also sells its own branded lighter fluid, but other brands of lighter fluid that are compatible can also be used. It's important to avoid using other types of fuels, such as gasoline or kerosene, as they can be dangerous and may damage the lighter."}
