{"question": "who were the first non native settlers in the us", "api_result": "The first non-Native settlers in what is now the United States were primarily European explorers and colonists. The Spanish were among the earliest, establishing settlements in the 16th century, such as St. Augustine in Florida in 1565, which is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the continental United States.\n\nFollowing the Spanish, the French and the English also established colonies. The French founded Quebec in Canada and explored parts of the present-day United States, while the English established their first permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. Other European nations, including the Dutch and Swedes, also established settlements in North America during the 17th century.\n\nThese early settlers were primarily motivated by the search for new trade routes, land, and opportunities for wealth, which led to significant interactions and conflicts with the Indigenous populations already living in these areas."}
