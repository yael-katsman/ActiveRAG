{"question": "when did the legal drinking age changed to 21", "api_result": "The legal drinking age in the United States was effectively changed to 21 with the passage of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. This law required all states to raise and enforce the minimum legal drinking age to 21. States that did not comply faced a reduction in federal highway funds. Most states had already raised their drinking age to 21 by the late 1980s."}
