{"question": "when was the last time anyone was on the moon", "api_result": "The last time humans visited the Moon was during NASA's Apollo 17 mission, which took place in December 1972. The astronauts on that mission were Eugene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt, and Ronald Evans. Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spent about three days on the lunar surface, with Cernan being the last person to walk on the Moon. Since then, no humans have returned to the Moon, although there are plans for future missions, including NASA's Artemis program."}
