{"question": "when was the cat and mouse act introduced", "api_result": "The Cat and Mouse Act, officially known as the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913, was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1913. It was designed to address the situation of hunger-striking prisoners, allowing for their temporary release if they became too ill due to their protest. Once they recovered, they could be re-arrested to serve the remainder of their sentence. The act was a response to the tactics used by suffragettes and other political prisoners who engaged in hunger strikes to protest their treatment."}
