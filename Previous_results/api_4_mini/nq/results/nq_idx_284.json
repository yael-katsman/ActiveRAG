{"question": "who made the nuclear model of an atom", "api_result": "The nuclear model of the atom was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. This model emerged from his famous gold foil experiment, where he observed that most alpha particles passed through a thin sheet of gold, but some were deflected at large angles. This led him to conclude that atoms consist of a small, dense nucleus containing positively charged protons, surrounded by negatively charged electrons in a relatively large volume of empty space. Rutherford's work laid the foundation for the modern understanding of atomic structure."}
