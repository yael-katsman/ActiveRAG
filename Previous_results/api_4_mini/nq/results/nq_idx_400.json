{"question": "where does the sciatic nerve run in the foot", "api_result": "The sciatic nerve does not run directly in the foot; instead, it is a large nerve that originates in the lower back and travels down through the buttocks and into the back of the thigh. It then branches into two main nerves: the tibial nerve and the common peroneal (fibular) nerve, which continue down the leg and into the foot.\n\nIn the foot, the tibial nerve further divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves, which provide sensation and motor function to the sole of the foot. The common peroneal nerve branches into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves, which supply the top of the foot and parts of the lower leg.\n\nSo, while the sciatic nerve itself does not run in the foot, its branches are responsible for innervating the foot and providing sensation and movement."}
