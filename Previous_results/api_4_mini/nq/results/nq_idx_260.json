{"question": "what are the four requirements to establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter", "api_result": "To establish criminal liability for gross negligence manslaughter, the following four requirements typically need to be met:\n\n1. **Duty of Care**: The defendant must owe a duty of care to the victim. This means that the defendant had a legal obligation to act (or refrain from acting) in a way that would avoid causing harm to the victim.\n\n2. **Breach of Duty**: The defendant must have breached that duty of care. This involves demonstrating that the defendant's conduct fell below the standard of care expected in the circumstances, which a reasonable person would have adhered to.\n\n3. **Causation**: There must be a direct causal link between the defendant's breach of duty and the victim's death. This means that the breach must have been a significant factor in bringing about the death.\n\n4. **Gross Negligence**: The negligence must be considered \"gross.\" This means that the conduct was so severe that it amounted to a criminal act, demonstrating a disregard for the life and safety of others. The standard for gross negligence is higher than ordinary negligence and involves a serious departure from the standard of care expected.\n\nThese elements must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction of gross negligence manslaughter. The specific application of these principles can vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to consider local laws and legal precedents."}
