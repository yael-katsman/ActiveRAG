{"question": "who were the two mathematicians that invented calculus", "api_result": "The two mathematicians credited with the independent development of calculus are Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Newton developed his version of calculus in the mid-1660s, focusing on the concepts of motion and change, while Leibniz developed his notation and ideas around the same time in the late 1670s and early 1680s. Their contributions laid the foundation for modern calculus, although they used different notations and approaches. The priority dispute between their followers led to significant controversy in the mathematics community."}
