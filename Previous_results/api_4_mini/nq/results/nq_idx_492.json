{"question": "which layer of the osi model handles physical addressing", "api_result": "The layer of the OSI model that handles physical addressing is the **Data Link Layer** (Layer 2). This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and includes protocols that manage how data packets are placed on the physical medium. It uses MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to identify devices on the same local network."}
