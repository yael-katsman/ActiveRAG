{"question": "what type of writing did ancient egypt use", "api_result": "Ancient Egypt used several forms of writing, the most notable of which are:\n\n1. **Hieroglyphics**: This is perhaps the most famous form of Egyptian writing, consisting of pictorial symbols that represent sounds, words, or concepts. Hieroglyphics were used for religious texts, monumental inscriptions, and official documents.\n\n2. **Hieratic**: This is a cursive form of hieroglyphics used primarily for writing on papyrus. It was more practical for everyday writing and was used by priests and scribes for administrative and literary texts.\n\n3. **Demotic**: This evolved from hieratic and became the common script for daily use in Egypt by the late period. It was used for a variety of documents, including legal and commercial texts.\n\n4. **Coptic**: This is the latest stage of the Egyptian language and was written using the Greek alphabet with some additional characters. It emerged in the early Christian period and was used by Egyptian Christians.\n\nThese writing systems played a crucial role in administration, literature, religion, and culture in ancient Egypt."}
