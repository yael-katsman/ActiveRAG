{"question": "who opens the church of the holy sepulchre", "api_result": "The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem is traditionally opened by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, who has the primary responsibility for the church. However, the church is also shared by several other Christian denominations, including the Roman Catholic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church, among others. The management and access to the church are governed by a status quo arrangement that has been in place since the 19th century, which outlines the rights and responsibilities of each denomination regarding the church."}
