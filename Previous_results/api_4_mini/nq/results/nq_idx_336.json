{"question": "what is the revolution period of venus in earth years", "api_result": "The revolution period of Venus, which is the time it takes to complete one orbit around the Sun, is approximately 225 Earth days. To convert this into Earth years, you can divide by the number of days in a year (about 365.25, accounting for leap years):\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Revolution period in Earth years} = \\frac{225 \\text{ days}}{365.25 \\text{ days/year}} \\approx 0.616 \\text{ years} \n\\]\n\nSo, Venus takes about 0.615 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun."}
