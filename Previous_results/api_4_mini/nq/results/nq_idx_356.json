{"question": "a bond that the issuer has the right to pay off before its maturity date", "api_result": "A bond that the issuer has the right to pay off before its maturity date is known as a **callable bond**. Callable bonds give the issuer the option to redeem the bond at a specified price before the maturity date, typically at a premium. This feature is beneficial for issuers if interest rates decline, as they can refinance their debt at a lower cost. However, callable bonds usually offer higher yields to compensate investors for the added risk of early redemption."}
