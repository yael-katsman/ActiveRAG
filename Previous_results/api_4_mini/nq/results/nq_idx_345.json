{"question": "two examples where low voltage transformers are used", "api_result": "Low voltage transformers are commonly used in various applications. Here are two examples:\n\n1. **Landscape Lighting**: Low voltage transformers are often used in outdoor landscape lighting systems. These transformers convert standard line voltage (120V or 240V) to a lower voltage (typically 12V or 24V) to power outdoor lights safely. This reduces the risk of electric shock and allows for easier installation of lighting fixtures in gardens, pathways, and patios.\n\n2. **Doorbell Systems**: Many doorbell systems utilize low voltage transformers to step down the household voltage to a lower level, usually around 16V. This is essential for powering the doorbell chime and the button without the risk of high voltage, ensuring safety and compatibility with low voltage doorbell components.\n\nThese examples illustrate the versatility and safety benefits of using low voltage transformers in various applications."}
