{"question": "term limits for house of representatives and senate", "api_result": "As of now, there are no term limits for members of the U.S. House of Representatives or the Senate. Representatives serve two-year terms, while Senators serve six-year terms. Both can be re-elected an unlimited number of times. \n\nThe idea of implementing term limits has been proposed multiple times, but it has not been enacted at the federal level. Some states have established term limits for their own legislatures, but such measures do not apply to federal offices. Advocates for term limits argue that they could help reduce career politicians and promote fresh ideas, while opponents contend that they could lead to a loss of experienced lawmakers and disrupt the legislative process."}
