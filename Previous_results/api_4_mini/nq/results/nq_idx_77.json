{"question": "what is the breakdown product formed when one phosphate group is removed from atp", "api_result": "When one phosphate group is removed from adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the breakdown product formed is adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This reaction typically releases energy that can be used by the cell for various biological processes. The reaction can be summarized as follows:\n\nATP \u2192 ADP + Pi\n\nwhere Pi represents inorganic phosphate."}
