{"question": "when are you considered under the poverty line", "api_result": "The poverty line is a threshold used to determine whether an individual or family has enough income to meet basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. In the United States, the poverty line is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau and is updated annually based on inflation and other economic factors.\n\nAs of 2023, the federal poverty guidelines for the contiguous United States are as follows:\n\n- For a single individual: $14,580\n- For a family of two: $19,720\n- For a family of three: $24,860\n- For a family of four: $30,000\n\nThese figures increase with the size of the family. For example, each additional person typically adds about $5,140 to the poverty threshold.\n\nIt's important to note that poverty thresholds can vary by location, as some areas have higher costs of living. Additionally, different countries have their own definitions and measures of poverty. Always refer to the most current guidelines from relevant authorities for the most accurate information."}
