{"question": "where does a roadrunner live in the desert", "api_result": "Roadrunners are commonly found in the deserts of the southwestern United States and Mexico. They prefer arid environments, particularly in areas with sparse vegetation, such as deserts, scrublands, and open grasslands. Their habitat typically includes regions with low shrubs, cacti, and rocky outcrops, which provide both shelter and hunting grounds for their prey. The Greater Roadrunner, in particular, is well adapted to the desert climate and is often seen running along the ground in search of food."}
