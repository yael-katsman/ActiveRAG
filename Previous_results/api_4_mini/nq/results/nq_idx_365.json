{"question": "who makes the important government decisions in an autocracy", "api_result": "In an autocracy, important government decisions are typically made by a single individual or a small group of individuals who hold significant power and authority. This central figure, often referred to as an autocrat, dictator, or supreme leader, has the ultimate control over the state's policies and governance. The decision-making process in an autocracy is characterized by limited political pluralism, restricted public participation, and often a lack of checks and balances. As a result, the autocrat's decisions can significantly shape the direction of the government and the lives of its citizens without the need for consensus or democratic processes."}
