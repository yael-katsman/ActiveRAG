{"question": "what does the air gap do on a dishwasher", "api_result": "The air gap on a dishwasher is a crucial component designed to prevent backflow of dirty water into the dishwasher from the sink or plumbing system. It serves as a physical barrier that ensures that wastewater cannot siphon back into the dishwasher, which could contaminate clean dishes with dirty water.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Installation**: The air gap is typically installed on the countertop or sink, connected to the dishwasher's drain hose and the sink's drain line.\n\n2. **Function**: During the dishwasher's draining cycle, water is pumped out through the drain hose. If there is a blockage or backup in the sink's drain, the air gap allows air to enter the system, breaking the siphon effect and preventing wastewater from flowing back into the dishwasher.\n\n3. **Maintenance**: It's important to keep the air gap clean and free of debris to ensure it functions properly. If it becomes clogged, it can lead to water backing up and potentially leaking.\n\nOverall, the air gap is an important safety feature that helps maintain hygiene and prevents cross-contamination between clean and dirty water."}
