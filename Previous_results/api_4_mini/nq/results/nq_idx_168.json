{"question": "what is the origin of the word celsius", "api_result": "The word \"Celsius\" is derived from the name of the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who was born in 1701 and died in 1744. He is best known for developing the Celsius temperature scale, which is a metric scale for measuring temperature. \n\nCelsius proposed his temperature scale in 1742, where he defined the freezing point of water at 0 degrees and the boiling point at 100 degrees under standard atmospheric conditions. This scale was later inverted to the more commonly used format we see today, where 0 degrees Celsius corresponds to the freezing point of water and 100 degrees Celsius corresponds to the boiling point.\n\nThe term \"Celsius\" was officially adopted in 1948 by the International System of Units (SI) to honor Anders Celsius and his contributions to the field of thermometry."}
