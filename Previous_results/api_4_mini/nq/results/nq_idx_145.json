{"question": "tools made from high-speed tool steel are generally used for what type of machining operations", "api_result": "Tools made from high-speed tool steel (HSS) are generally used for machining operations that require high cutting speeds and durability. These tools are commonly employed in various machining processes, including:\n\n1. **Turning**: HSS tools are used in lathes for shaping and finishing cylindrical parts.\n2. **Milling**: HSS end mills and milling cutters are used for creating complex shapes and profiles in materials.\n3. **Drilling**: HSS drill bits are widely used for creating holes in various materials.\n4. **Tapping**: HSS taps are used for creating internal threads in drilled holes.\n5. **Reaming**: HSS reamers are used for finishing holes to precise dimensions and improving surface finish.\n\nOverall, HSS tools are favored for their ability to withstand high temperatures and maintain sharp cutting edges, making them suitable for a wide range of machining applications, particularly in metalworking."}
