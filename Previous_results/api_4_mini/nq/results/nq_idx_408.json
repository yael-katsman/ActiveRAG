{"question": "what is the first line of an http request to the server", "api_result": "The first line of an HTTP request is known as the request line. It typically consists of three parts: the HTTP method, the request target (which can be a path or a URL), and the HTTP version. \n\nFor example, a common request line for a GET request might look like this:\n\n```\nGET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `GET` is the HTTP method.\n- `/index.html` is the request target (the resource being requested).\n- `HTTP/1.1` is the version of the HTTP protocol being used."}
