{"question": "who created the borders of africa's countries", "api_result": "The borders of Africa's countries were largely established during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily as a result of European colonialism. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, where European powers met to discuss the partitioning of Africa, played a crucial role in defining these borders. The conference aimed to regulate European colonization and trade in Africa, leading to the arbitrary drawing of borders that often disregarded the continent's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic divisions.\n\nColonial powers such as Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy imposed borders that often split ethnic groups and combined disparate communities into single political entities. After many African countries gained independence in the mid-20th century, these colonial-era borders were largely retained, leading to ongoing challenges related to national identity, governance, and conflict."}
