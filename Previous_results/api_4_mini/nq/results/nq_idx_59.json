{"question": "which greek god flew too close to the sun", "api_result": "The Greek figure who flew too close to the sun is Icarus. According to mythology, Icarus and his father, Daedalus, escaped from Crete using wings made of feathers and wax. Despite his father's warnings not to fly too high, Icarus became overconfident and flew too close to the sun, causing the wax in his wings to melt. As a result, he fell into the sea and drowned. This story serves as a cautionary tale about hubris and the consequences of ignoring wise advice."}
