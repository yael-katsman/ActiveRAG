{"question": "what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "api_result": "The first step in the evolution of the eye is believed to be the development of simple light-sensitive cells. These primitive photoreceptor cells allowed organisms to detect light and dark, which provided a significant survival advantage by helping them navigate their environment, find food, and avoid predators. Over time, these simple structures evolved into more complex forms, leading to the development of various types of eyes seen in different species today. This gradual process involved the enhancement of light detection capabilities, the formation of lenses, and the development of more intricate structures for image formation."}
