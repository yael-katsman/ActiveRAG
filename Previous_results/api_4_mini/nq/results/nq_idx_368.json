{"question": "what was the most important new religious figure of the new kingdom of ancient egypt", "api_result": "The most important new religious figure of the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt was Akhenaten, originally known as Amenhotep IV. He is notable for introducing a form of monotheism centered around the worship of Aten, the sun disk. This religious shift marked a significant departure from the traditional polytheistic practices of ancient Egyptian religion. Akhenaten established a new capital at Amarna and promoted the worship of Aten above all other gods, which had profound implications for Egyptian society, art, and religion during his reign (circa 1353\u20131336 BCE). His reforms were largely reversed after his death, but his legacy remains a pivotal moment in the history of ancient Egyptian religion."}
