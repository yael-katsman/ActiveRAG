{"question": "what is the highest base on the ph scale", "api_result": "The pH scale typically ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Values below 7 indicate acidity, while values above 7 indicate alkalinity (basicity). The highest value on the pH scale is generally considered to be 14, which represents a very strong base. However, in theory, pH values can exceed 14 in extremely concentrated alkaline solutions, but such values are not commonly encountered in typical situations."}
