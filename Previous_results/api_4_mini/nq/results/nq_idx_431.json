{"question": "who has played in the most masters tournaments", "api_result": "As of my last update in October 2023, the record for the most Masters Tournament appearances is held by Jack Nicklaus, who played in 44 Masters from 1957 to 2005. He is followed closely by Gary Player, who participated in 52 Masters tournaments. If you're looking for the most current statistics, I recommend checking the latest sources or the official Masters Tournament website for any updates beyond that date."}
