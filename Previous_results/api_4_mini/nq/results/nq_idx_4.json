{"question": "when did the first immigrants come to hawaii", "api_result": "The first significant wave of immigrants to Hawaii began in the 19th century, primarily during the period of sugar plantation expansion. The first group of immigrants were Chinese laborers, who arrived in the 1850s. Following them, large numbers of Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii starting in 1885. Other groups, including Portuguese, Filipino, and Korean immigrants, also arrived in subsequent years to work on the plantations. However, prior to these waves, Polynesians are believed to have settled in Hawaii around 1,500 years ago, making them the first inhabitants of the islands."}
