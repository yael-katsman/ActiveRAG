{"question": "other than water what else has hydrogen bonds", "api_result": "Hydrogen bonds can occur in various substances beyond water. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Ammonia (NH\u2083)**: Ammonia molecules can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of a nitrogen atom bonded to hydrogen atoms.\n\n2. **Alcohols**: Compounds like ethanol (C\u2082H\u2085OH) and methanol (CH\u2083OH) have hydroxyl (-OH) groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding.\n\n3. **Carboxylic Acids**: Molecules such as acetic acid (CH\u2083COOH) can form hydrogen bonds due to the presence of both a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group.\n\n4. **DNA**: The base pairs in DNA (adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine) are held together by hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the structure of the double helix.\n\n5. **Proteins**: Hydrogen bonds play a significant role in stabilizing the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins, such as alpha helices and beta sheets.\n\n6. **Sugars**: Many carbohydrates, such as glucose, can form hydrogen bonds due to their hydroxyl groups.\n\n7. **Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)**: HF can form hydrogen bonds due to the highly electronegative fluorine atom bonded to hydrogen.\n\nThese examples illustrate that hydrogen bonding is a common interaction in many organic and inorganic compounds, influencing their physical and chemical properties."}
