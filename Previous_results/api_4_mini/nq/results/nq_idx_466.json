{"question": "where does the cell spend most of its time in the cell cycle", "api_result": "The cell spends most of its time in the interphase stage of the cell cycle. Interphase is divided into three phases: G1 (gap 1), S (synthesis), and G2 (gap 2). During interphase, the cell grows, duplicates its DNA, and prepares for mitosis. In fact, interphase can account for about 90% of the total time a cell spends in the cell cycle, with the remaining time spent in the mitotic phase (M phase), where the actual division of the cell occurs."}
