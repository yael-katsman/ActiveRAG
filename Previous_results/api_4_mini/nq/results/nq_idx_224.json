{"question": "where does fungi go on a food web", "api_result": "In a food web, fungi typically occupy the role of decomposers. They break down dead organic matter, such as fallen leaves, dead plants, and animal remains, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. This process is crucial for nutrient cycling and helps maintain the health of the environment. \n\nFungi can also form symbiotic relationships with plants (mycorrhizae), aiding in nutrient absorption, or they can be pathogens that affect other organisms. However, their primary role in the food web is as decomposers, connecting producers (like plants) and consumers (like animals) by facilitating the flow of energy and nutrients."}
