{"question": "when did the ncaa tournament became more important than the nit", "api_result": "The NCAA Tournament began to overshadow the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The NCAA Tournament, which started in 1939, gradually gained prestige and popularity, especially after the introduction of the \"March Madness\" branding in the 1980s. \n\nSeveral factors contributed to this shift in importance:\n\n1. **Television Coverage**: The NCAA Tournament received extensive television coverage, which helped to increase its visibility and popularity among fans.\n\n2. **Expansion**: The NCAA Tournament expanded its field of teams over the years, allowing more schools to participate and increasing its appeal.\n\n3. **Perception of Prestige**: The NCAA Tournament began to be viewed as the premier postseason event in college basketball, while the NIT was seen as a secondary tournament.\n\nBy the 1980s, the NCAA Tournament was firmly established as the main event in college basketball, and the NIT was often viewed as a consolation prize for teams that did not make the NCAA field. This trend has continued, with the NCAA Tournament remaining the focal point of college basketball each spring."}
