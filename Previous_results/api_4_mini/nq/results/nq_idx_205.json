{"question": "what part of the brain is in the middle cranial fossa", "api_result": "The middle cranial fossa houses several important structures of the brain. Primarily, it contains parts of the temporal lobes, which are involved in processing auditory information and are also important for memory and emotion. Additionally, the middle cranial fossa contains the pituitary gland (which sits in the sella turcica), the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), and the cavernous sinus, which contains cranial nerves III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), V1 (ophthalmic), V2 (maxillary), and VI (abducens), as well as the internal carotid artery. The middle cranial fossa is also the location of the lateral aspects of the brainstem and the cerebellum."}
