{"question": "when did the us dollar leave the gold standard", "api_result": "The United States officially abandoned the gold standard in 1971. This event is often referred to as the \"Nixon Shock,\" which occurred when President Richard Nixon announced a series of economic measures, including the suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold. This effectively ended the Bretton Woods system, which had been in place since the end of World War II, and transitioned the U.S. and the global economy to a system of fiat currency. The complete abandonment of the gold standard for domestic transactions occurred in 1933 during the Great Depression, but the international gold standard was effectively ended in 1971."}
