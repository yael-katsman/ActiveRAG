{"question": "when did computer become widespread in homes and schools", "api_result": "Computers began to become widespread in homes and schools during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. The introduction of personal computers, such as the Apple II in 1977, the IBM PC in 1981, and other models from companies like Commodore and Tandy, made computers more accessible to the general public.\n\nIn schools, the integration of computers into the classroom gained momentum in the 1980s, particularly with initiatives aimed at improving computer literacy. By the 1990s, as prices continued to drop and software became more user-friendly, computers became a common fixture in both homes and educational institutions. The rise of the internet in the mid-1990s further accelerated this trend, making computers even more essential for communication, research, and learning."}
