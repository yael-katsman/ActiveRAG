{"question": "in the early 1800s california society was dominated by which group", "api_result": "In the early 1800s, California society was primarily dominated by Spanish and Mexican settlers. Following the Spanish colonization that began in the late 18th century, California became part of Mexico after its independence from Spain in 1821. During this period, the population included a mix of Indigenous peoples, Spanish settlers, and Mexican citizens. The social and economic structures were heavily influenced by the missions established by the Spanish, as well as by ranching and agriculture, which were central to the economy. The influence of these groups continued until the mid-19th century, when the Gold Rush and subsequent American annexation began to change the demographic and cultural landscape of California."}
