{"question": "what was the religion in persia before islam", "api_result": "Before the advent of Islam, the predominant religion in Persia (modern-day Iran) was Zoroastrianism. Founded by the prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) around the 6th century BCE, Zoroastrianism is one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions. It centers on the worship of Ahura Mazda, the supreme god, and emphasizes concepts such as truth, order, and the duality of good and evil. \n\nZoroastrianism was the state religion of various Persian empires, including the Achaemenid Empire, until the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century CE, which led to the gradual decline of Zoroastrianism as Islam became the dominant faith in the region."}
