{"question": "where is arachidonic acid found in the body", "api_result": "Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is primarily found in the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes throughout the body. It is particularly abundant in the brain, liver, and muscle tissues. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A2 and serves as a precursor for the synthesis of various bioactive lipids, including eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, which play crucial roles in inflammation, immune response, and other physiological processes. Additionally, arachidonic acid can be found in dietary sources, particularly in animal products like meat, eggs, and dairy, as well as in certain plant oils."}
