{"question": "who named all the animals in the world", "api_result": "The naming of animals is attributed to various cultures and individuals throughout history, rather than a single person. In the biblical tradition, Adam is said to have named all the animals in the Garden of Eden, as described in the Book of Genesis. However, in a scientific context, the modern system of naming animals (and plants) is known as binomial nomenclature, which was developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. Linnaeus established a standardized method for naming species using a two-part Latin name, which is still used today in biological classification. Since then, many scientists and taxonomists have contributed to the naming and classification of animals based on ongoing research and discoveries."}
