{"question": "who laid the foundation of school of possibilism", "api_result": "The foundation of the school of possibilism is primarily attributed to the French geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache. He developed this concept in the early 20th century as a response to environmental determinism, emphasizing that while the environment sets certain limits, human agency and culture play a significant role in shaping societies. Possibilism suggests that people can adapt to their environment and make choices that influence their development and way of life."}
