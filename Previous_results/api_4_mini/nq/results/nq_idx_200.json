{"question": "what does it mean to fuse the spine", "api_result": "Fusing the spine, also known as spinal fusion, is a surgical procedure that involves joining two or more vertebrae in the spine to eliminate movement between them. This is typically done to stabilize the spine, alleviate pain, or correct deformities. \n\nThe procedure can involve the use of bone grafts, metal rods, screws, or plates to hold the vertebrae together while they heal. Over time, the bone graft material encourages the vertebrae to grow together, effectively \"fusing\" them into a single, solid bone structure.\n\nSpinal fusion is commonly performed for various conditions, including:\n\n- Degenerative disc disease\n- Spinal stenosis\n- Spondylolisthesis\n- Herniated discs\n- Spinal deformities, such as scoliosis\n\nWhile spinal fusion can provide significant relief from pain and improve stability, it also has potential risks and complications, such as infection, blood loss, nerve damage, and the possibility of adjacent segment disease, where the vertebrae next to the fused area may experience increased stress and degeneration over time."}
