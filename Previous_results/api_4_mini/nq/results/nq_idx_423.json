{"question": "where does prime rib come from on a cow", "api_result": "Prime rib comes from the rib section of a cow, specifically from the primal cut known as the rib primal. This section is located between the chuck (shoulder) and the loin (back) of the animal. The prime rib cut typically includes ribs six through twelve and is known for its tenderness and rich flavor due to the marbling of fat within the meat. When prepared, it is often served as a roast and is a popular choice for special occasions and holiday meals."}
