Countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia), and Namibia (formerly South West Africa) were key areas of European settlement and control.\n\n6. **Island Nations**: Madagascar was colonized by France, while other islands like Seychelles and Mauritius also fell under European control.\n\nThe Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 formalized the scramble for Africa, leading to the partitioning of the continent among European powers, often without regard for indigenous cultures or existing political boundaries. The impacts of colonization are still felt in many African countries today."}
