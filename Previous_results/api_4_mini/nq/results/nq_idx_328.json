{"question": "what does a heart rate of 131 mean", "api_result": "A heart rate of 131 beats per minute (bpm) is considered elevated, especially if you are at rest. Normal resting heart rates for adults typically range from 60 to 100 bpm. A heart rate above this range can be influenced by various factors, including:\n\n1. **Physical Activity**: If you have been exercising or engaging in physical activity, an elevated heart rate is normal as your body requires more oxygen.\n\n2. **Emotional Stress**: Anxiety, stress, or excitement can increase your heart rate.\n\n3. **Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as fever, anemia, hyperthyroidism, or heart-related issues, can cause an elevated heart rate.\n\n4. **Stimulants**: Consumption of caffeine, nicotine, or certain medications can also raise your heart rate.\n\n5. **Dehydration**: Lack of fluids can lead to an increased heart rate as your body tries to maintain adequate blood flow.\n\nIf your heart rate of 131 bpm occurs at rest and is accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations, it is advisable to seek medical attention. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and evaluation."}
