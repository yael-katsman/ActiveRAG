{"question": "which animal on earth has the longest life span", "api_result": "The animal with the longest lifespan is often considered to be the **Greenland shark** (*Somniosus microcephalus*), which can live for over 400 years. Some estimates suggest that these sharks may even reach ages of up to 500 years. Other long-lived animals include the **bowhead whale**, which can live over 200 years, and certain species of **tortoises**, such as the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, which can live for more than 100 years. However, the Greenland shark holds the record for the longest confirmed lifespan among vertebrates."}
