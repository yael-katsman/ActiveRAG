{"question": "when did the study of media effects begin", "api_result": "The study of media effects began in the early 20th century, particularly with the rise of mass media such as newspapers, radio, and film. One of the earliest significant studies was conducted in the 1920s and 1930s, notably the \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast in 1938, which demonstrated the potential for media to influence public perception and behavior.\n\nThe field gained further prominence with the establishment of the \"hypodermic needle\" or \"magic bullet\" theory, which suggested that media messages could have a direct and powerful effect on audiences. This theory was prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nIn the post-World War II era, researchers began to adopt more nuanced approaches, leading to the development of various theories and models of media effects, such as the two-step flow of communication and the uses and gratifications theory. The field has continued to evolve, incorporating insights from psychology, sociology, and communication studies to better understand the complex interactions between media and audiences."}
