{"question": "who is the current defence against the dark arts teacher", "api_result": "As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, the \"Defense Against the Dark Arts\" teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry varies depending on the book or film in the Harry Potter series. In the original series, different characters held the position in each book, including Quirinus Quirrell, Gilderoy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Dolores Umbridge, Severus Snape, and Amycus Carrow. \n\nIf you are referring to a specific adaptation, such as a play, video game, or fan fiction, please provide more context, and I can help you better!"}
