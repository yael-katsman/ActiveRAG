{"question": "why wasnt agent matthews in miss congeniality 2", "api_result": "In \"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous,\" Agent Matthews, played by Benjamin Bratt, does not appear due to the actor's scheduling conflicts and the direction the filmmakers chose to take with the sequel. The film focuses more on Sandra Bullock's character, Gracie Hart, and her new adventures, which allowed for the introduction of new characters and storylines. As a result, Matthews' absence was a narrative choice rather than a reflection of the character's importance."}
