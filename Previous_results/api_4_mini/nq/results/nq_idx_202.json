{"question": "is jaffa cakes a biscuit or a cake", "api_result": "Jaffa Cakes are classified as cakes, despite their biscuit-like appearance. This classification was famously established in a UK court case in 1991, where it was determined that Jaffa Cakes are cakes for tax purposes. The key distinction is that cakes, when they go stale, harden, while biscuits become soft. Jaffa Cakes also have a sponge base, which is characteristic of cakes. So, while they may resemble biscuits, they are legally and technically considered cakes."}
