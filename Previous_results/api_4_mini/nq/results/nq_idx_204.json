{"question": "when does the sa node begin electrical signaling", "api_result": "The sinoatrial (SA) node, often referred to as the heart's natural pacemaker, begins electrical signaling at the very early stages of embryonic development. In a fully developed heart, the SA node generates electrical impulses that initiate the heartbeat, typically starting around the 5th week of gestation. \n\nIn a healthy adult heart, the SA node fires electrical signals at a rate of about 60 to 100 beats per minute, which triggers the contraction of the atria and subsequently the ventricles, coordinating the heart's rhythm. The SA node's activity is influenced by the autonomic nervous system, which can adjust the heart rate based on the body's needs."}
