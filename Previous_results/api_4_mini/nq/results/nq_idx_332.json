{"question": "who coined the phrase let them eat cake", "api_result": "The phrase \"Let them eat cake\" is often attributed to Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France during the French Revolution. However, there is no definitive evidence that she actually said this. The phrase is believed to have been used to illustrate her perceived indifference to the plight of the poor, suggesting that if the peasants could not afford bread, they could simply eat cake instead. The quote is widely regarded as a symbol of the disconnect between the monarchy and the common people during that period."}
