The ancient Mayans were known for their advanced knowledge in astronomy and mathematics, as evidenced by their creation of a complex calendar system that accurately tracked celestial events.\n2. The Mayan Long Count calendar, which spans over 5,000 years, has led to speculation about predictions for the end of the world in 2012. However, there are different interpretations and correlations regarding the end date of the Long Count, and the significance of this date in Mayanism is subject to speculation and varying beliefs.\n3. Mayan artifacts have been found that predict dates well into the future, indicating that the Mayans had a concept of time that extended beyond the year 2012.\n4. The significance of the year 2012 in Mayanism is not solely based on a specific day but has been subject to interpretation and speculation by various individuals, including modern authors.\n\nAnswer:\nThe ancient Mayans did not predict any specific apocalyptic event or the end of the world. The significance of the year 2012 in Mayanism is subject to interpretation and speculation, and there is no conclusive evidence that the ancient Mayans predicted an apocalyptic event for 2012 or any other specific date."

In 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published the specifications for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet-switching among the nodes.

Through his experiments, Mendel discovered the basic principles of heredity, including the concepts of dominant and recessive traits, as well as the independent assortment of different traits.\n3. His work led to the formulation of Mendel's Laws, which laid the associate for the field of genetics and provided a crucial understanding of genetic inheritance.\n4. Mendel's discoveries addressed a major problem with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and provided a mechanism to explain the connection and ancestry of all living things.\n5. Despite initially receiving little notice, Mendel's experiments eventually gained recognition and he is now considered the father of modern genetics.\n\nAnswer:\nGregor Mendel's contribution was the discovery of the basic principles of heredity through his experiments with pea plants, leading to the formulation of Mendel's Laws and the associate of the field of genetics.
