This title was also granted to sons-in-law, male-line grandchildren of the sovereign, other agnates of the ruling dynasty, and female-line relatives of the monarch. The inheritance rules for Spanish noble titles historically followed the rule of male-preference primogeniture, allowing a female to succeed if she had no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. Additionally, the Spanish succession laws did not prevent a female from ascending the throne, as seen in the case of Infanta Ana of Spain, who was the heiress presumptive to the throne before her marriage.\n\nAnswer:\nThe title given to the daughters of the Kings of Spain and Portugal who were not the heir to the throne was \"Infanta\" in Spanish or \"Infanta\" in Portuguese."

The Bissett family, who owned Rathlin Island, welcomed Robert the Bruce and his men, but they were later dispossessed of the island by the English for their support.\n3. Edward I believed that Robert the Bruce was hiding somewhere among the islands on the western seaboard, indicating the complexity and intrigue surrounding his refuge.\n\nAnswer:\nGiven the uncertainty and multiple potential locations for Robert the Bruce's refuge, it is widely believed that Rathlin Island off the Northern Ireland coast was the refuge for the Scottish King in 1306. Therefore, the Scottish King who sought refuge on Rathlin Island in 1306 was Robert the Bruce."
