While working with magnetrons, he noticed that a candy bar in his pocket had melted, leading him to experiment with popcorn kernels, which then popped when he placed them near the magnetron.\n3. This accidental discovery led to further experiments and the development of the world's first microwave oven by Raytheon under Percy Spencer in 1947, which was demonstrated by cooking popcorn and heating food using microwave energy from a magnetron.\n\nAnswer:\nThe microwave oven was invented in the 1940s by Percy Spencer while working at Raytheon, where he developed the world's first microwave oven in 1947, based on his accidental discovery of microwave cooking while working on radar sets."

Cortes and his Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Aztec Empire in 1519, where Moctezuma II was the ruler.\n2. Moctezuma II initially welcomed Cortes, believing him to be the returning god Quetzalcoatl.\n3. However, tensions arose between the Aztecs and the Spanish, leading to the seizure and imprisonment of Moctezuma II by Cortes.\n4. During Moctezuma II's captivity, a massacre of Aztec nobles by Pedro de Alvarado further escalated the conflict.\n5. Moctezuma II's brother, Cuitlahuac, was elected as the new emperor after Moctezuma II's deposition.\n6. The internal power struggles within the Aztec leadership and the ongoing conflict with the Spanish ultimately led to the downfall of the Aztec Empire.\n\nAnswer:\nMoctezuma II"

Additionally, the song was also performed by the German singer Sandra on her album \"Fading Shades\" in 1995. This contradicts the model's existing knowledge, which may be that the song was only performed by The Moody Blues. Adding this new information to the model's knowledge will prevent factual errors and alleviate model illusions.\n\nAnswer:\nThe hits \"Go Now\" and \"Nights in White Satin\" were by The Moody Blues, with \"Nights in White Satin\" also being performed by the German singer Sandra on her album \"Fading Shades\" in 1995."

Edward I believed that Robert the Bruce was hiding somewhere among the islands on the western seaboard, indicating the complexity and intrigue surrounding his refuge.\n\nAnswer:\nGiven the uncertainty and multiple potential locations for Robert the Bruce's refuge, it is widely believed that Rathlin Island off the Northern Ireland coast was the refuge for the Scottish King in 1306.
