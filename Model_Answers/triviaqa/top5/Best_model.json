The remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in The Kimberley, Western Australia, indicating the potential for long-term reef formation. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area for at least 40,000 years, and Torres Strait Islanders have been present for about 10,000 years, highlighting the deep historical connection between the reef and human presence. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system off the coast of Australia, underscoring its global significance.\n\nBased on this knowledge, the estimation of the living part of the Great Barrier Reef being approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years old takes into account the geological formation of the reef, the historical presence of human populations in the area, and the growth of the living coral and marine life. This estimation aligns with the understanding of the reef's development and the age of its living components.\n\nTherefore, the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef is approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years old."

In some religions, the notion of heaven is divided into different parts or levels based on the individual's actions and beliefs during their lifetime, as well as their relationship to God's love in some ancient Eastern Christian traditions.\n2. These divisions are often based on concepts such as righteousness, piety, adherence to religious laws, and the individual's spiritual state in relation to God's love.\n3. Additionally, the concept of the seven heavens in religious cosmology, found in Abrahamic religions such as Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, as well as in some Indian religions such as Hinduism, further illustrates the division of heaven into parts or levels.\n\nAnswer:\nWhere certain religions divide the notion of heaven into parts, there are generally different levels or parts of heaven based on individual actions, beliefs, and spiritual state, as well as the individual's relationship to God's love in some traditions. This division may also be represented by the concept of the seven heavens in religious cosmology."

This title was also granted to sons-in-law, male-line grandchildren of the sovereign, other agnates of the ruling dynasty, and female-line relatives of the monarch. The inheritance rules for Spanish noble titles historically followed the rule of male-preference primogeniture, allowing a female to succeed if she had no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. Additionally, the Spanish succession laws did not prevent a female from ascending the throne, as seen in the case of Infanta Ana of Spain, who was the heiress presumptive to the throne before her marriage.\n\nAnswer:\nThe title given to the daughters of the Kings of Spain and Portugal who were not the heir to the throne was \"Infanta\" in Spanish or \"Infanta\" in Portuguese."

The Futhark has historical and cultural significance, as it was used by Germanic tribes for Northwest Germanic dialects in the Migration Period. Additionally, the encoding of the Elder Futhark in Unicode within the unified Runic range demonstrates its modern relevance and accessibility. The correspondence between the runic alphabets and the Gothic alphabet further enriches our understanding of the Futhark's historical and linguistic context.\n\nAnswer:\nThe Futhark is a runic alphabet."
