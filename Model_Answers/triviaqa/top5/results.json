A proper fraction is a fraction where the numerator (the top number) is smaller than the denominator (the bottom number). This means that the fraction represents a value less than 1. Additionally, it's important to understand that fractions can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, resulting in an equivalent fraction.\n\nThe numerator in a fraction represents the number of equal parts being described, while the denominator represents the total number of parts that make up a whole. When the numerator is smaller than the denominator, it indicates that the fraction represents a part of a whole, rather than a whole number or a number greater than 1.\n\nAnswer:\nFor a proper fraction, the numerator is always smaller than the denominator. The numerator represents the number of equal parts being described, and it is crucial in determining the value of the fraction in relation to the whole."

To enhance the reasoning process, I will incorporate the retrieved knowledge to further elaborate on the historical context and significance of MMORPG design.\n\nEnhanced reasoning process with retrieved knowledge:\nThe term MMORPG, coined by Richard Garriott, refers to massive multiplayer online role-playing games and their social communities. It has its origins in the MUD genre, with games of this style being called graphical MUDs before the term MMORPG was established. The first fully graphical multi-user RPG, \"Neverwinter Nights,\" delivered through America Online in 1991, played a pivotal role in the early development of MMORPGs and was championed by AOL President Steve Case. \"Ultima Online,\" released in 1997, is often credited with popularizing the MMORPG genre.\n\nUnderstanding these historical milestones and the diverse range of contributors, including small teams of programmers and artists, provides insight into the evolution and significance of MMORPG design. This context helps to underscore the influential role of figures like Raph Koster, Brad McQuaid, Mark Jacobs, Brian Green, and J. Todd Coleman in shaping the MMORPG genre and its impact on the gaming industry.\n\nAnswer based on the enhanced reasoning process:\nMMORPG stands for Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game.

He emphasizes the importance of establishing credibility (Ethos) and appealing to the emotions of the audience (Pathos) in addition to presenting a logical argument (Logos).\n\nAristotle's concept of persuasion shares similarities with the psychological approach of the Yale model, which also emphasizes the importance of credibility, emotions, and logical reasoning in persuasive communication. This comparison provides a broader understanding of the components of persuasion from both philosophical and psychological perspectives.\n\nFurthermore, the development of new theories on organizational communication by Peter Senge in the early 1990s and the conceptual framework for analyzing mediated interaction developed by sociologist John Brookshire Thompson offer additional insights into different theories and frameworks related to communication and persuasion.\n\nAnswer:\nAristotle"
