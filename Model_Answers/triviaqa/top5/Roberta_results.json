The remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in The Kimberley, Western Australia, indicating the potential for long-term reef formation. Aboriginal Australians have been living in the area for at least 40,000 years, and Torres Strait Islanders have been present for about 10,000 years, highlighting the deep historical connection between the reef and human presence. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system off the coast of Australia, underscoring its global significance.\n\nBased on this knowledge, the estimation of the living part of the Great Barrier Reef being approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years old takes into account the geological formation of the reef, the historical presence of human populations in the area, and the growth of the living coral and marine life. This estimation aligns with the understanding of the reef's development and the age of its living components.\n\nTherefore, the living part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef is approximately 6,000 to 8,000 years old."

This flexibility allows the infant's head to pass through the birth canal without obstruction and also supports the continued growth and development of the head after birth. Additionally, understanding craniosynostosis, a condition where the cranial sutures fuse prematurely, can provide insights into the potential consequences of abnormal skull development.\n\nAnswer:\nFontanelles"
