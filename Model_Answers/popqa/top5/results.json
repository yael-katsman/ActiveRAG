It also acknowledges the differing interpretations of Ali's role in Sunni and Shia traditions, as well as the existence of different sects and beliefs within Islam.\n\nEnhanced reasoning process:\nMuhammad Ali was initially associated with the Nation of Islam, which combined elements of Islam with black nationalism. However, after the death of the Nation's leader, Elijah Muhammad, he converted to Sunni Islam and was inspired by Sufism later in his life. His significance in Islamic history is notable, with differing interpretations of his role in Sunni and Shia traditions. Sunni scholars recognize him but not as an Imam, while Shia Muslims view him as the chosen successor of Muhammad. Additionally, there are different sects and beliefs within Islam, such as the case of Muhammad ibn Falah, an Iraqi theologian who founded a Shi'a sect and believed himself to be the earthly representative of Imam Ali and the Mahdi, but was later denounced as a heretic and excommunicated.\n\nAnswer:\nThe religion of Muhammad Ali was Sunni Islam, although his spiritual journey also involved an association with the Nation of Islam and an inspiration by Sufism."
