This misinformation could confuse the model and hinder its ability to accurately answer the question.

However, the model should be cautious about relying on outdated or potentially biased sources for accurate information.\n\nEnhanced reasoning process:\nCyprus is a country in the Eastern Mediterranean, and historically, Nicosia has been recognized as its capital.
