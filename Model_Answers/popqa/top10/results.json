To enhance the reasoning process, we can further explore the historical and cultural significance of Tokyo as the capital, as well as its role in shaping Japan's political and economic landscape.\n\nRetrieved knowledge:\nTokyo has been the capital of Japan since 1868, when Emperor Meiji moved the imperial capital from Kyoto to Tokyo. This marked the beginning of Tokyo's transformation into a modern metropolis and the center of political, economic, and cultural activities in Japan. Tokyo's status as the capital has been solidified through its role as the seat of the Japanese government, including the Imperial Palace, the National Diet, and various government ministries and agencies.\n\nEnhanced reasoning process:\nTokyo's historical significance as the imperial capital since the Meiji Restoration and its central role in governance, economy, and culture further solidify its status as the capital of Japan. The city's transformation into a modern metropolis and its concentration of political and administrative institutions underscore its importance as the capital, shaping the country's development and identity.\n\nAnswer:\nTokyo is the capital of Japan, with its historical significance dating back to the Meiji Restoration in 1868.
