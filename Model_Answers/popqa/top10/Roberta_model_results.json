The film was the second of three films directed by Ashby and produced by Lorimar Productions. The screenplay for the film was originally intended for the NBC anthology series \"NBC Experiment in Television\" in 1968. Additionally, there is an album titled \"Second Hand Heart\" by Dwight Yoakam, and songs with the same title by Danny Gokey and Ben Haenow. The song \"Second Hand Heart\" was written by Mark Gray, Harold Tipton, and Craig Karp, and recorded by Gary Morris in 1984.\n\nBased on this information, we can infer that \"Second-Hand Hearts\" is likely a romantic comedy-drama, given the director's previous works and the comedic elements associated with the film. The historical context of the screenplay's origin and the connection to music with similar titles also suggests a romantic and comedic theme.\n\nAnswer:\nRomantic comedy-drama"
